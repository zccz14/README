# README

A place to store personal thoughts and insights.

This website is built by me using [ZEN](https://zccz14.github.io/ZEN).

And ZEN is a project purely generated through Vibe-Coding. I resisted writing any line of code, acting as a "project manager" throughout the process, and I intend to stick to this approach.

It's quite simple to use, incorporating some of my personal aesthetics and preferences. However, it hasn't been officially released yet and still falls short of my expectations.

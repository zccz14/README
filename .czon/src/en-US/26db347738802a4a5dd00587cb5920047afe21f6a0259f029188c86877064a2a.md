"title": "The Capital Long Game: A Strategic Practice Guide for Individual Investors"
"summary": "This article revolves around the revision and discussion of the piece 'The Capital Long Game.' The author reflects on avoiding excessive academic language, aiming to provide strategic practice guidance in plain language. Core viewpoints include: the fundamental purpose of the capital long game is to allow individual investors to leave the market after achieving victory, not to pursue stable profits; the difference between the market and a lottery is that the former is a game of strategy where one can improve win rates through tactics; even if many adopt this strategy, profitability remains possible due to differences in underlying tactics; the collective action problem does not apply to this strategy as it does not assume a unified underlying tactic; theoretical validation can be achieved by backtesting to measure a strategy's T_S performance and defining a failure threshold. The author also shares interactions with the AI tool OpenCode and plans to build an adversarial generative Agents framework."

It is the evening of January 21, 2026.

Yesterday, I spent a great deal of effort revising the article [The Capital Long Game](czon://14f13a8dd1577bd68d3caec4485c71f5cffa6f1b636a5a0c42a584bb47c3691e). After discussing it with friends and engaging in a deep back-and-forth with an AI, I received some feedback. I worked until exhaustion and didn't continue writing the log, saving it for today.

**Terminology and Academic Tone**

I have given up on the idea of citing numerous sources to pretend this essay is highly persuasive. After all, for this kind of article, only successful practice lends it credibility. While it contains philosophical elements, I haven't formally studied philosophy, so I can't pretend to be an expert. Rather than feigning knowledge, it's better to honestly admit I haven't read those works and avoid using philosophical jargon to mislead others and myself. As for economic terminology, I'd rather not dwell on it. It's inherently a highly interpretive field, with various schools of thought endlessly debating; being self-consistent is sufficient.

This was never intended as an academic publication but as an article providing strategic practice guidance. It should use plain language that everyone can understand. An overly academic tone can make it seem aloof and inaccessible. Who has the time to read several monographs just to understand an article?

**Fundamental Purpose**

The fundamental purpose of the Capital Long Game is to allow individual investors to leave the market after achieving victory, not to be trapped in the market for a lifetime. The pursuit of stable profits is essentially a false proposition. Making enough money in one go is the correct way to reach the shore. View the market as a ferry boat meant to reach the other side, not to drift on it forever. Therefore, clearly defining the victory standard is the primary issue. Without a clear victory standard, how can one discuss strategy?

**How is it Different from a Lottery?**

A lottery is ostensibly a fair, random game of chance. The market, however, is a game of strategy disguised as a game of chance. Investors can improve their odds of "winning" by refining their tactics, while lottery players rely solely on luck.

**If Everyone Adopts This Strategy, Will it Still Be Profitable?**

Yes. Because this strategy does not specify the underlying tactics. Everyone can have different underlying tactics while using this strategy to manage risk and capital. Therefore, even if everyone adopts this strategy, their floating profits will differ at various stages, their directional judgments and the assets they participate in may vary, leading to significant differences and preventing overcrowding.

**Regarding the "Collective Action Problem"**

During one exchange, the AI brought up the "collective action problem," where individual and collective interests diverge, and individual actions can harm the collective, making such actions difficult to implement. However, I argued that individuals in the market cannot guarantee increased personal returns through a specific action; adding to a position with floating profits also carries the risk of losing everything. The collective action problem applies to shared underlying tactics. But the Capital Long Game does not assume everyone adopts the same underlying tactics.

**Regarding Theoretical Validation**

One can use backtesting to measure a strategy's T_S performance. Especially by backtesting on very long historical data, focusing on changes in the frequency of achieving victory. Furthermore, I defined a quantitative expression for strategy failure: when T_S exceeds a threshold unacceptable to a human investor, for example, 3 years. We can also study the distribution of a strategy's T_S over very long-term data to gather more supporting evidence.

So, I asked OpenCode + MiniMax M2.1 to help me implement a backtesting framework to verify this. Enough said; it produced something completely off-topic.

Today, to integrate OpenCode as part of the build process, I battled with OpenCode for what felt like three hundred rounds and was defeated. It's a precious record of early human attempts to tame AI. I realized I can't keep avoiding building an Agents framework. After all, I've written several pieces on my own Agents theory[^1] [^2] [^3], and this is the trend of the future. So, I decided to tackle this problem head-on.

I decided to first build a minimal adversarial generative Agents framework to prevent the AI from cutting corners. I believe this is a very fundamental module, the foundation of all agent systems. Its function is to have two agents adversarially generate outputs, thereby improving output quality. This module should be generic and applicable to various agent systems.

Today, I was wrestling with OpenCode; C1 was wrestling with GitHub Project integration; and Brother Ji was wrestling with market manipulators on PolyMarket. And RYAN was wrestling with the notification module...

In short, everyone worked hard today.

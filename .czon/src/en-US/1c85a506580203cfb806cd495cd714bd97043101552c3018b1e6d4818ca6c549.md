"summary": "This article analyzes why Agents underperform compared to one-shot LLMs in translation tasks, including high token usage, decreased translation quality, and YAML Frontmatter formatting errors. The author believes the Agent design is better suited for multi-step reasoning and decision-making tasks, and its context management strategy prevents it from fully utilizing information for translation. The article also mentions that Agents may enter infinite loops when translating low-resource languages. To address these issues, the author proposes two improvement approaches: using an Agents/Sub-Agents framework to decompose the translation task, or using Skills to assemble a low-level one-shot LLM API for the Agent to call. The author prefers the first approach and discusses OpenCode's support for complex Agent calls.

It is now January 23, 2026, early morning.

Unfortunately, I've found that Agents perform worse than one-shot LLMs in direct translation tasks. It seems the strength of Agents lies more in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and decision-making, rather than simple single-step tasks. Agents use 10 times the number of tokens as an LLM, yet the translation quality actually regresses, especially with YAML Frontmatter sometimes being translated incorrectly, leading to formatting errors.

My initial intention was to use them to solve the issue of one-shot LLMs exceeding maximum output length limits in long-text translation tasks, but it appears it's not that simple. Consequently, I rolled back this feature in CZON@0.5.2 to reconsider the approach.

I believe this is likely because Agent scenarios typically involve complex tasks with massive amounts of information. Therefore, they are designed to read and write to context as little as possible, prioritizing local file read/writes to increase their data processing capacity. This context management strategy means they don't default to incorporating all information, preventing them from utilizing context as fully as a one-shot LLM would for translation.

Interestingly, for some low-resource language translation tasks (e.g., Simplified Chinese to Indonesian), Agents can occasionally exhibit behavior like repeatedly translating in an infinite loop, failing to converge to a stable translation result. This might be due to a flaw in how the Edit tool handles certain languages, causing it to fail at correctly replacing text and thus getting stuck in a loop. (Being too frugal might also have its problems.)

I've thought of two potential solutions:

1.  Use an Agents / Sub-Agents framework to decompose the translation task, for example, an adversarial generation framework involving translation and proofreading.
2.  Use Skills to assemble a low-level one-shot LLM API, allowing the Agent to call a translation skill instead of attempting the translation itself.

I might prefer the first solution, as its potential seems higher. I'm just not sure about OpenCode's level of support for complex Agent calls.

Additionally, the CZON update log:

-   0.5.0: Integrated OpenCode for translation tasks. (However, this introduced performance issues with large numbers of file translations, later fixed.)
-   0.5.1: Fixed an issue where frontend static resources (tailwindcss) failed to load due to inability to access jsdelivr from within China. (Achieved by downloading CDN files locally during the build phase.)
-   0.5.2: When a slug already exists, it is no longer updated to prevent slug changes from content modifications. (Avoids historical link breakage due to log file renaming); Rolled back the Agent translation feature, removing OpenCode integration for translation tasks.

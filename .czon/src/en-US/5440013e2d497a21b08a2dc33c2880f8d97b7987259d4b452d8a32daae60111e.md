"title": "ZEN Project Renamed to CZone and 1.0.0 Version Features Planned"
"summary": "This article documents the author's conversation with Thrimbda on the evening of January 8, 2026, discussing the future development of the ZEN project. Thrimbda suggested turning ZEN into a publishable knowledge base, supporting features like custom frontends, themes, permanent links, document lists, and carousels. The author believes that after completing these features, ZEN 1.0.0 could be released and has started considering a release plan. Meanwhile, the author discovered that the name ZEN is already used by multiple projects on GitHub and decided to rename it to CZone (czon). This name is not taken on npm, is shorter, and is suitable for a CLI tool. The project will be hosted under a subdomain of a personal domain, with no plans for commercialization."

Today is January 8, 2026, in the evening.

I slept in the morning and got up in the evening to chat with Thrimbda about the future direction of ZEN. Here are some thoughts I’d like to record.

He suggested considering turning ZEN into a publishable knowledge base and mentioned that if it could support custom frontends, he would migrate his blog to it. Specifically, his requirements can be broken down into supporting custom themes, permanent links, document lists, and carousels.

I think after completing these features, it would indeed be possible to release a ZEN 1.0.0 version. Perhaps I should start drafting a release plan.

However, I noticed that the name ZEN has been overused—there are several projects named ZEN on GitHub. Maybe I should consider changing the name. I want a relatively short name that is at least not taken on npm, since it will eventually be launched using the npx command, and the CLI name shouldn’t be too long. I plan to host it under a subdomain of my personal domain. It doesn’t need an independent second-level domain, as I have no intention of turning it into a commercial project.

After searching through a bunch of names, I finally settled on CZone `czon`, which stands for cz + zone (cz zone, content zone), representing an area for content and knowledge. `czon` is not taken on npm. By the way, when I tried to register `czone`, npm said it was too similar to `clone` and wouldn’t allow it. But `czon` is also good—it’s even shorter.

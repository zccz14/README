"title": "Discussion on the Future Development of the ZEN Project and Renaming to CZone"
"summary": "This document records the author's discussion with Thrimbda on the evening of January 8, 2026, regarding the future development of the ZEN project. Thrimbda suggested transforming ZEN into a publishable knowledge base that supports custom frontends, themes, permanent links, document lists, and carousels, to facilitate migrating his blog. The author believes that after these features are completed, ZEN version 1.0.0 could be released and considers drafting a release plan. Meanwhile, the author discovered that the name ZEN is already used by multiple projects on GitHub, prompting consideration of a rename. Ultimately, CZone (czon) was chosen as the new name because it is short, available on npm, and fits the need for a subdomain under a personal domain."

Today is January 8, 2026, in the evening.

I slept in the morning and got up in the evening to chat with Thrimbda about the future direction of ZEN. Here are some thoughts from our discussion.

He suggested considering transforming ZEN into a publishable knowledge base and mentioned that if it could support a custom frontend, he would migrate his blog to it. Specifically, his requirements can be broken down into supporting custom themes, permanent links, document lists, and carousels.

I think after completing these features, it would indeed be appropriate to release ZEN version 1.0.0. Perhaps I should draft a release plan.

However, I noticed that the name ZEN is overused—there are several projects named ZEN on GitHub. Maybe I should consider renaming it. I want a relatively short name that is at least not taken on npm, since it will ultimately be launched using an npx command, and the CLI name shouldn't be too long. I plan to host it under a subdomain of my personal domain. It doesn't need an independent second-level domain since I don't intend to commercialize the project.

After searching through many names, I finally settled on CZone `czon`, which stands for cz + zone (cz zone, content zone), representing an area for content and knowledge. `czon` is not taken on npm. By the way, when I tried to register `czone`, npm said it was too similar to `clone` and wouldn't allow it. But `czon` is also good—it's even shorter.

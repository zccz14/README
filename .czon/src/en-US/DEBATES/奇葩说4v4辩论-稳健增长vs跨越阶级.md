## 一、Opening: Ma Dong's "Weird" Survey

**Ma Dong**: (Taps the wooden fish) Good evening, everyone! Welcome to the wealth special edition of "The Weird Debate"! Today we're playing big—a 4v4 team debate!

(Audience cheers)

**Ma Dong**: Before introducing the debaters, let's do a brutal survey. How many people in the audience feel that, based on your current income growth, you'll be able to afford a house in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, or Shenzhen in your lifetime? Raise your hands.

(Less than 10 people raise their hands)

**Ma Dong**: Okay, put them down. Now, how many feel that without making changes, the trajectory of your life is already clearly predictable?

(Over 70 people raise their hands)

**Ma Dong**: (Sighs) This is the soil for today's debate. On one side, a stable but potentially mediocre present; on the other, a risky but potentially exciting future.

**Ma Dong**: Let's first welcome our four mentors! Brother Kangyong, what's your take on this topic?

**Cai Kangyong**: This topic reminds me of Xiren and Qingwen in "Dream of the Red Chamber". Xiren chose stability, Qingwen chose excitement. In the end, Xiren married Jiang Yuhan, and Qingwen died of illness. But the problem is, we are not fictional characters; no author is arranging our endings.

**Xue Zhaofeng**: From an economics perspective, this is a question of allocating human capital versus financial capital. When young, human capital is high, so one should take more risks; when old, financial capital has accumulated, so one should seek stability.

**Li Dan**: If you ask me, this topic is simply—when young, you think "I can leap classes"; in middle age, you think "better be steady"; in old age, you think "if only I had... back then." Life is just constant regret.

**Liu Qing**: What I'm concerned about is whether this "class leap" narrative itself is a fantasy woven by consumerism, or a genuine struggle of individuals within structural constraints?

**Ma Dong**: Alright, enough talk, let's welcome today's two teams!

## 二、Opening Statements: 4v4 Viewpoint Presentation

### Pro Side First Speaker: Wang Wenjian (Rational Data Advocate)

**Wang Wenjian**: (Takes out a tablet) Everyone, I'm Wang Wenjian, a financial planner. First, let me show you some data.

(Charts appear on screen)

**Wang Wenjian**: Among Chinese stock investors, seven lose, two break even, one profits. Among that "one who profits," how many rely on luck? I surveyed 100 self-proclaimed "stock gods"; only 3 were still consistently profitable three years later.

**Wang Wenjian**: Steady growth isn't about earning less; it's about higher certainty. Let me do the math for you: If you start at age 25, invest 3,000 yuan monthly via DCA with an 8% annual return, by age 60 you'll have 5.17 million. At 10%, you'll have 7.45 million.

**Wang Wenjian**: I know someone will mention inflation. But have you considered that if you take a risk and fail, you won't even have the qualification to fight inflation.

**Wang Wenjian**: **Steady growth is not a choice; it is the anchor of certainty for ordinary people in an uncertain world.**

### Con Side First Speaker: Zhang Ganchuang (Serial Entrepreneur)

**Zhang Ganchuang**: (Stands up, passionately) Mr. Wang's data looks great, but I ask: Does that data include delivery drivers, programmers, small shop owners? Or is it just data from your financial planning clients?

**Zhang Ganchuang**: I'm Zhang Ganchuang. I've started three businesses, failed twice, succeeded once. First failure lost 500k, second lost 1 million, third success earned 8 million.

**Zhang Ganchuang**: According to the steady growth faction's calculation, I should be down 1.5 million. But reality is, I netted 6.5 million. Why? Because the one success covered all the failures.

**Zhang Ganchuang**: This is the core idea of the Capital Persistence War: **Use controllable small losses to secure one decisive victory.**

**Zhang Ganchuang**: I'm not calculating single-attempt success rates, but mathematical expectation. E = p × big gain - (1-p) × small loss. As long as p is not zero, doing it long-term yields positive expectation!

### Pro Side Second Speaker: Professor An (Psychology Professor)

**Professor An**: (Gently but firmly) Mr. Zhang's story is inspiring, but I'd like to offer a psychological reality check.

**Professor An**: The human brain is not good at handling probability. When you say "p is not zero," people hear "there's a chance." But "having a chance" and "being able to seize the chance" are two different things.

**Professor An**: Behavioral finance has a concept called "loss aversion": The pain of losing 100 yuan requires the joy of gaining 200 yuan to offset. Most people, after a series of small losses, make irrational decisions—either give up or gamble bigger.

**Professor An**: The greatest advantage of steady growth isn't the rate of return, but psychological stability. It lets you sleep at night, doesn't affect quality of life, doesn't damage family relationships.

**Professor An**: **The first step in investing isn't making money; it's not ruining your life because of investing.**

### Con Side Second Speaker: Chen Suanfa (Quantitative Trader)

**Chen Suanfa**: (Adjusts glasses) Professor An is right, humans aren't good with probability. So, we let machines handle it.

(Code appears on screen)

**Chen Suanfa**: This is my trading system. Input parameters: Maximum daily loss 200 yuan, profit scaling factor 1.5, stop-loss line set at pre-scaling loss. Fully automated execution.

**Chen Suanfa**: In backtesting over the past three years, this system had a maximum drawdown of 12,000 yuan, a single maximum profit of 187,000 yuan. Win rate 37%, but profit-to-loss ratio 8.2.

**Chen Suanfa**: What does that mean? I lose more often, but lose little each time; I win less often, but win big. Long-term, annualized return is 46%.

**Chen Suanfa**: **The Capital Persistence War isn't about courage; it's about algorithms. Emotion is the enemy of investment; programs are the antidote to emotion.**

### Pro Side Third Speaker: Qian Manman (Retired Civil Servant)

**Qian Manman**: (Smiles kindly) Young Chen's algorithm is impressive, but this old man wants to share some life experience.

**Qian Manman**: I'm 65 this year. I started DCA at 35, a full 30 years. I lived through the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2000 Dot-com Bubble, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the 2015 Stock Market Crash, the 2016 Circuit Breakers, the 2020 Pandemic.

**Qian Manman**: I never sold at the peak, never bought at the bottom. Just foolishly bought a little every month after getting paid. Now my account has 3.2 million.

**Qian Manman**: This 3.2 million isn't a lot, but it's enough for my retirement, enough for my grandson's down payment, enough for my wife's medical bills.

**Qian Manman**: What about my old colleagues who traded stocks with me back then? Old Li got margin called, still working to pay off debts. Old Wang followed tips into crypto, lost his entire pension. Old Zhao...

**Qian Manman**: (Pauses) **Slow and steady wins the race. Living long is the greatest compound interest.**

### Con Side Third Speaker: Zhao Keji (AI Engineer)

**Zhao Keji**: Grandpa Qian, I respect your experience. But I want to say, your era has passed.

**Zhao Keji**: In 1990, a "ten-thousand-yuan household" was rich. Today, earning over ten thousand a month is normal. Why? Because the economic growth model has changed.

**Zhao Keji**: The past was linear growth, so steadiness worked. Now it's exponential growth—AI, biotech, new energy. Opportunity windows are short; missing them means missing out for a lifetime.

**Zhao Keji**: I work in AI. Now with ChatGPT, an ordinary person can write a simple trading program in one day. Ten years ago, that required a professional programmer for a month.

**Zhao Keji**: Technology has lowered the barrier to class leaps. **Steady growth is an industrial-era strategy; leaping classes is a digital-era survival rule.**

### Pro Side Fourth Speaker: Li Shicheng (Ordinary Office Worker)

**Li Shicheng**: (Nervous but sincere) Hi everyone, I am that "majority of ordinary people."

**Li Shicheng**: Monthly salary 8,000, mortgage 5,000, child's school 2,000, basically living paycheck to paycheck. I tried stock trading, lost three months' salary, my wife almost divorced me.

**Li Shicheng**: Later, I followed Mr. Wang Wenjian's advice, forced myself to save 500 monthly, bought index funds. After three years, I have over 20,000.

**Li Shicheng**: Not much, but it's my daughter's college fund, my parents' emergency money, the backbone that lets me say "no" to my boss.

**Li Shicheng**: Leap classes? I'd like to. But I can't afford to lose. I have a family behind me, responsibilities.

**Li Shicheng**: **For most ordinary people, steadiness isn't the optimal solution; it's the only solution.**

### Con Side Fourth Speaker: Sun Xianshi (Midlife Crisis Representative)

**Sun Xianshi**: (Tired but determined) Xiao Li, I understand you. I'm 42, exactly the age you call "can't afford to lose."

**Sun Xianshi**: But let me tell you, sometimes it's not about whether you want to lose or not; it's reality forcing you to gamble.

**Sun Xianshi**: My father has cancer, surgery costs 300k. My son wants to attend a private middle school, sponsorship fee 200k. My company is laying off, I might be jobless next month.

**Sun Xianshi**: At times like this, what use is the 500-yuan monthly profit from steady growth? A drop in the bucket!

**Sun Xianshi**: Last year I started learning the Capital Persistence War framework. Maximum loss 200 per day, that's my psychological bottom line. I wrote a simple trend-following strategy in Python.

**Sun Xianshi**: Three months, lost 8,000. Fourth month, caught a market wave, made 70,000. That 70,000 was my father's lifesaving money.

**Sun Xianshi**: **When steady growth can't save your life, leaping classes isn't a choice; it's survival.**

## 三、Cross-Examination: Crossfire

**Ma Dong**: Alright, now entering the cross-examination round! Both sides may question each other!

### Round 1: Zhang Ganchuang vs. Wang Wenjian

**Zhang Ganchuang**: Mr. Wang, in your data, did you count those who missed era-defining opportunities because they were "steady"? Like not buying Tencent in 2000, Bitcoin in 2010, new energy in 2020?

**Wang Wenjian**: Mr. Zhang, my data also counts those who went bankrupt because they "took risks." Survivorship bias makes you only see the successes.

**Zhang Ganchuang**: But the successes changed their destinies; the failures just maintained the status quo. Isn't that a gamble worth taking?

**Wang Wenjian**: Maintain the status quo? Mr. Zhang, bankruptcy isn't maintaining the status quo; it's getting worse. Many who go bankrupt can't even return to the "status quo."

### Round 2: Chen Suanfa vs. Professor An

**Chen Suanfa**: Professor An, you said humans have emotional issues. If trading is fully automated, eliminating emotional influence, does that solve the psychological risk you mentioned?

**Professor An**: Theoretically, yes. But in practice, people always intervene with the program. When winning, they think "I can make more"; when losing, they think "the machine doesn't understand the market."

**Chen Suanfa**: That's why discipline is needed. The Capital Persistence War emphasizes "programmatic execution" precisely to combat human weakness. This isn't a psychological problem; it's an execution problem.

**Professor An**: Mr. Chen, if execution were that easy, there would be no overweight people in the world. Everyone knows about healthy eating and exercise, but how many can actually do it?

### Round 3: Zhao Keji vs. Qian Manman

**Zhao Keji**: Grandpa Qian, you made 3.2 million in 30 years. But have you considered that if in 1990 you had invested your house-buying money in the stock market, it might be worth 30 million now?

**Qian Manman**: (Laughs) Xiao Zhao, in 1990 my monthly salary was 80 yuan, where would I get money to buy a house or stocks? You young people always think the past was paved with gold.

**Zhao Keji**: What about now? The AI era offers more opportunities. A high school student used AI to write code for quantitative trading, made 500k in three months. This is happening!

**Qian Manman**: For every high school student making 500k, there are 100 losing 500k. You only see the successful one.

### Round 4: Sun Xianshi vs. Li Shicheng

**Sun Xianshi**: Xiao Li, you say you can't afford to lose. But have you thought that if you don't change, your situation in 10 years might be worse than now? Inflation, age discrimination, technological replacement...

**Li Shicheng**: Brother Sun, I understand. But I think steady growth at least ensures I'll be a little better off in 10 years. Risk-taking could be better, or it could be worse.

**Sun Xianshi**: A little better? Do you know how much retirement costs now? Do you know how much studying abroad costs? Is your "little better" enough?

**Li Shicheng**: (Silent) Not enough... but it's better than getting worse.

## 四、Free Debate: 8-Person Melee

**Ma Dong**: Now entering free debate! Time: 3 minutes!

**Wang Wenjian**: The con side keeps talking about exceptions! But investing looks at probabilities! The high probability is that ordinary people lose money!

**Zhang Ganchuang**: The high probability is mediocrity! But isn't life about betting on low-probability events? Marriage is low probability, entrepreneurial success is low probability, even winning the lottery is low probability!

**Professor An**: But betting on low probability requires capital! Ordinary people don't have trial-and-error capital!

**Chen Suanfa**: That's why the Capital Persistence War emphasizes "controllable losses"! Maximum 200 loss per day, that's what ordinary people can bear!

**Qian Manman**: 200 is still money! For someone earning 3,000 a month, 200 is two days' food money!

**Zhao Keji**: Then when can someone earning 3,000 a month turn their life around through steady growth? Do the math for him!

**Li Shicheng**: At least it won't get worse! My father said, better eat a steady bowl of porridge than gamble for a feast!

**Sun Xianshi**: My father said the same thing! But he's in the hospital now, and steady porridge can't pay the medical bills!

(The scene gets heated)

**Ma Dong**: Time's up! Both sides, please calm down!

## 五、Closing Statements: Final Shout

### Con Side Closing: Zhang Ganchuang

**Zhang Ganchuang**: Finally, I want to say we are not encouraging gambling. We are providing a framework—a scientific, controllable framework for leaping classes that ordinary people can also operate.

**Zhang Ganchuang**: The four pillars of the Capital Persistence War:

1.  **Cash Flow Bottom Line**: Have a regular job; losses don't affect living.
2.  **Programmatic Execution**: Let the machine do it; avoid emotional decisions.
3.  **Profit Scaling**: Amplify gains when winning.
4.  **Strict Stop-Loss**: Control losses when losing.

**Zhang Ganchuang**: This isn't a "get rich or go broke" gamble; it's a mathematical game of "possible small losses, possible big wins."

**Zhang Ganchuang**: **Steady growth is society's stabilizer, but leaping classes is the breakthrough point for personal destiny. In an era of solidification, we need our own points of disruption.**

### Pro Side Closing: Wang Wenjian

**Wang Wenjian**: The con side makes good points, but overlooks a key issue—execution difficulty.

**Wang Wenjian**: The Capital Persistence War requires: financial knowledge, programming ability, psychological fortitude, disciplined execution. Out of these four, how many does the ordinary person possess?

**Wang Wenjian**: Among my clients who tried similar strategies, out of 100, 3 succeeded, 97 failed. The reason for failure wasn't a bad strategy; it was inability to execute.

**Wang Wenjian**: And upon investigation, those 3 who succeeded were already in finance or IT.

**Wang Wenjian**: What is the greatest advantage of steady growth? Simplicity. Dollar-cost averaging into index funds, even a grade-schooler can do it.

**Wang Wenjian**: **Leaping classes is a game for the elite; steady growth is a boon for the masses. We cannot demand mass execution of elite playstyles.**

## 六、Audience Vote & Mentor Commentary

**Ma Dong**: Now, let the 100 audience members vote! Press red for "Steady Growth," blue for "Leap Classes"!

(Voting music plays)

**Ma Dong**: The results are in! Steady Growth: 48 votes! Leap Classes: 52 votes!

**Ma Dong**: Very close! The con side wins by a narrow 4-vote margin!

### Mentor Commentary

**Xue Zhaofeng**: I voted for steady. But economically, this result is interesting—52% are willing to take risks. This indicates a high level of social anxiety.

**Liu Qing**: I voted for leap. Not because I believe in success, but because the "leap classes" narrative itself is a spiritual weapon for ordinary people against structural oppression.

**Cai Kangyong**: I abstained. Because I think this choice should be staged. Choose to leap when young, choose steady after middle age. But the problem is, many lack the capital to leap when young, and lack the time for steadiness in middle age.

**Li Dan**: I voted for steady. Because I know that most of those shouting about leaping classes end up neither leaping classes nor growing steadily. They drift in the middle, in the most pain.

**Ma Dong**: Let me add one point. Whichever side you choose, remember three principles:

1.  **Don't invest in what you don't understand**: Learn first, then act.
2.  **Act within your means**: Invest money you can afford to lose without affecting your life.
3.  **Stay healthy**: Live long to see compound interest, or to wait for opportunities.

### Core Framework Comparison:

**Steady Growth (Pro Framework)**:

*   Core: Time + Compound Interest + Asset Allocation + Long-term Holding
*   Advantages: Simple to execute, psychologically stable, high certainty
*   Disadvantages: Slow speed, difficult to handle sudden large expenses
*   Suitable for: Risk-averse individuals, those with weak execution, long-term planners

**Leap Classes (Con Framework - Capital Persistence War)**:

*   Core: Controllable Losses + Programmatic Trading + Profit Scaling
*   Advantages: High upside potential, strong ability to handle emergencies, fits the pace of the times
*   Disadvantages: High execution difficulty, significant psychological pressure, requires continuous learning
*   Suitable for: Risk-tolerant individuals, those with technical skills, those urgently needing change

### Simulated Online Comments:

*   **@InvestingNewbie**: After listening, I'm even more confused... both sides seem to make sense
*   **@CoderMakingMoney**: I'm trying Chen Suanfa's method! Using GPT to write trading programs, currently up 15%
*   **@MiddleAgedUncle**: Sun Xianshi spoke my heart! Steady can't save you in an emergency!
*   **@PsychStudent**: Professor An is right! Investment mindset is so important!
*   **@RetiredAuntie**: Support Qian Manman! Young people are too impatient!
*   **@AIEntrepreneur**: Zhao Keji's view represents the future! Technology changes everything!
*   **@IndebtedYouth**: Li Shicheng is me... I really can't afford to lose
*   **@SerialEntrepreneur**: Zhang Ganchuang gets me! Entrepreneurship is a war of attrition!

### Practical Guide (Not Investment Advice):

**If you choose Steady Growth**:

1.  Open a DCA account, set up automatic deductions after each paycheck.
2.  Choose low-fee broad-market index funds (e.g., CSI 300, S&P 500).
3.  Set a goal: Stick with it for 10 years without touching it.
4.  Forget about it, focus on work and life.

**If you choose Leap Classes (Capital Persistence War)**:

1.  Ensure you have stable job-based cash flow.
2.  Learn basic Python and financial knowledge (or use AI assistance).
3.  Set strict risk controls: Max single-day loss = 20% of daily salary.
4.  Start with a paper trading account; real money should not exceed 3 months' salary.
5.  Keep a trading journal, regularly review and optimize.

**Hybrid Strategy (Recommended for Most)**:

*   70% funds for Steady Growth (DCA into index funds)
*   20% funds to attempt Leap (Capital Persistence War framework)
*   10% cash reserve (for opportunities and risks)

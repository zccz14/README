# The Protracted War of Capital (Draft)

Modified on 2026-01-20, first draft on 2026-01-17.

## Core Idea

**How to transcend class through capital investment?**

**Use the losses you can afford to bear, to pursue a return you 'cannot afford' to miss.**

This is not about stable profits, nor is it about going all-in for sudden wealth. It is the optimal solution for the risk-reward ratio.

Three mainstream views exist in the market, but none of them solve the problem of individual investors transcending class:

1.  **The 'Individuals are Doomed to Fail' Theory** - Believing one is destined to be exploited, thus avoiding the market.
2.  **The 'All-in for Sudden Wealth' Theory** - Wanting to win or lose everything in one go, leading to uncontrolled risk.
3.  **The 'Steady Development' Theory** - Wanting to get rich slowly, but lacking sufficient time.

This article proposes a fourth approach: **Use the minimal acceptable risk to pursue potentially massive, victory-defining returns.**

## The Problem Statement

As individual investors, the purpose of surviving and developing in the market is to achieve sustained wealth growth, ultimately aiming to transcend class.

We often yearn to discover a method for stable profits leading to success, or fantasize about seizing an opportunity for overnight riches. Both are often difficult to achieve: the former because market competition is fierce and strategies can never remain perpetually victorious; the latter because the risks are too high and often require heavy bets. There are many voices, such as the "individuals are doomed to fail" theory that claims one can never beat the market and investing is destined to lose money, the "all-in for sudden wealth" theory of betting it all, and the "steady development" theory that wealth accumulation must rely on time. These are erroneous views that do not solve the initially stated problem. You can always see people getting rich overnight in the market, and many others going bankrupt, with some floating in the market their entire lives. Consequently, many people simplistically attribute the problem to either ability or luck.

This is essentially a problem with how the issue is defined. The market has never clearly defined what the standard for "success" is. If an investor only focuses on metrics like "annualized return," "maximum drawdown," "profit-loss ratio," or "Sharpe ratio," they have never defined what the endpoint of investing is. If a return target is met this year, what about next year? When does the battle end? When can victory be declared? Fighting a war where victory can never be defined is destined to be impossible to win.

I wish to propose a new perspective on the survival and development strategy for individual investors in the market. **I believe that waging a protracted war is the only path for individual investors to transcend class.** Briefly, a protracted war refers to a strategic combination of **controllable losses, cumulative advantage, and aggressive pursuit of victory.** It is not a protracted war in the temporal sense, but rather a strategy to achieve leapfrog wealth growth through a publicly definable approach.

1.  The Principle of No Unnecessary Risk: Control the maximum rate of loss to ensure survival capability during weakness.
2.  The Principle of No Waste: Trade time for advantage. Use systematic trading to avoid emotional decisions and achieve continuous expansion of advantage.
3.  The Principle of No Delay: Utilize pyramiding (adding to winning positions) to aggressively pursue victory without procrastination, achieving leapfrog wealth growth.
4.  The Principle of No Ambiguity: Clearly define strategic objectives and victory conditions before committing, avoiding vague strategic disorientation.

I firmly oppose any strategic outcome that "permanently traps individuals in the market." This is an immense waste of human life and societal resources.

To solidify this stance, clarify the fundamentals, and differentiate from other views, I will refute the three common erroneous views in the market one by one:

### **Refuting the 'Individuals are Doomed to Fail' Theory (Cynicism)**

Many believe that individual investors can never beat the market and are destined to lose money.

Their reasons roughly fall into 4 points:

1.  Individuals' limited information is at a disadvantage compared to the market's complete information.
2.  Individuals' limited capital is at a disadvantage compared to the market's infinite capital.
3.  Individuals' limited knowledge is at a disadvantage compared to professional teams or institutions.
4.  The market contains fixed "drainage" mechanisms, such as transaction fees, taxes, etc., which erode profit margins.

This view overlooks the learning capacity and adaptability of individual investors. The market is a game-theoretic system; the relationship between exploiters and the exploited is dynamic and symbiotic. If the exploited disappear, the exploiters lose their basis for existence. Moreover, this ecology forms a cycle, creating a dynamic equilibrium of triangular game relationships. Often, choosing an ecological niche is key to an individual investor's success, not whether one can obtain absolute advantage. Holders of the "doomed to fail" theory view the market too one-sidedly, ignoring its complexity and dynamism. **This is a typical mindset of seeing a flaw and negating the entire thing.**

Holders of this view often also believe that the ultimate winners are always large institutions and professional teams. However, professional teams also started as individual investors. They grew into professional teams through continuous learning and adaptation to the market. Institutions and individuals differ merely in form, scale, resources, and stage of development, not in essence. Individual investors can absolutely, through a protracted war, gradually accumulate experience and capital, ultimately achieving the goal of transcending class.

There is also a subtle variation of this view, which posits that a winner-takes-all scenario might eventually emerge, where individual investors can never survive in the market and will be entirely eliminated. If this were truly the case, the exploiters would lose their basis for existence, and the market ecology could not be sustained. Therefore, this view is also untenable.

Furthermore, this is a **cynical** viewpoint, attempting to evade the reality of the market by negating the capabilities of individual investors. By not participating in this market, can individual investors truly avoid being exploited? This is merely an ostrich mentality. The economy has long engulfed everyone. In today's world, most currencies are pegged to the US dollar, whose value is closely tied to US Treasury bonds, which fund US development. Many people accumulate wealth but dare not invest in the market, only to find their wealth constantly shrinking due to inflation, ultimately becoming the exploited. In the future, even if the US falls, another country will take up the baton and continue issuing the global reserve currency. This is unavoidable because the essence of wealth is control over resources. Wealth that cannot be exchanged for resources from others is ultimately illusory.

**The entire world is already "chained together."**

Faced with this situation, there are two choices: withdrawal from the world (出世) or engagement with it (入世). Clearly, withdrawal is beyond the scope of this article; those who transcend need not worry about wealth.
Since withdrawal is not an option, one must engage. **Individual investors must face the reality of the market, accept its challenges, to find their place within it.** Individual investors need to continuously learn and adapt to the market, gradually accumulating experience and capital, ultimately achieving the goal of transcending class.

**Although individual investors are at a disadvantage in many aspects, they possess a unique political cost advantage: independence.**

Any decision involving more than one interest-bearing entity faces political problems of **coordination costs** and **conflicts of interest.** Individual investors do not have these problems. Their independence allows them to adjust strategies more flexibly and focus more intently on their own goals without needing to consider others' interests. This independence enables individual investors to find their niche in the market and, through continuous learning and adaptation, ultimately achieve sustained wealth growth.

Obviously, in terms of investment decision-making, it's hard to say that multiple people are necessarily more advantageous than one person. From decision-making ability, financial power, execution capability, and other aspects, individual investors do not have inherent defects.

For example, the following lists some relative advantages stemming from the political cost advantage:

*   Adaptability: Individual investors can at least choose not to participate in certain markets, or choose to learn and adapt to market changes, with no taboos. Institutions often need to maintain established business models, making rapid adjustment difficult.
*   Flexibility: Allows individual investors to quickly adjust strategies to adapt to market changes without going through cumbersome approval processes. Institutions often require multi-layer approvals, leading to slow responses.
*   Liquidity: Individual investors can enter and exit markets almost without restriction, choosing different investment instruments and markets. Institutions are often constrained by capital size and regulatory requirements.

If individual investors can fully leverage these advantages and continuously learn and adapt to the market, they absolutely have the potential to succeed in the market. In the AI era, individual investors can use AI tools to quickly compensate for their disadvantages, such as obtaining information, analyzing data, **writing code for trading strategies**, etc., thereby enhancing their advantages. Especially writing code for trading strategies, as mentioned later, systematic trading at the execution level is key to implementing the protracted war. Even if an individual investor cannot code themselves, they can use AI to assist in writing code to achieve systematic trading, which is already a proven feasible solution.

### **Refuting the 'All-in for Sudden Wealth' Theory (Opportunism)**

On the other hand, a minority in the market advocate the strategy of "betting it all to turn a bicycle into a motorcycle," believing that a one-time high-risk investment can achieve rapid wealth growth. This strategy seems to solve the time problem of personal wealth growth but actually ignores the importance of risk management. Those who hold this view and act on it are either novices uninitiated by the market or impoverished gamblers with little left to lose. They often believe their luck can overcome market risks, but reality is often otherwise.

All-in investments often come with enormous risks. Once they fail, they can lead to severe personal wealth loss or even bankruptcy. Moreover, market opportunities are not something everyone can seize; the probability of success is often very low. Therefore, relying solely on an all-in investment strategy cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. Currently, in the MEME market, there are many myths of sudden wealth, with stories of overnight thousand-fold or ten-thousand-fold gains emerging endlessly, attracting a large number of speculators into the market. However, these stories often ignore the underlying risks and failure cases, leading many speculators chasing the dream of sudden wealth to ultimately fall into bankruptcy.

Some people appear to go all-in, but in reality, the funds they actually commit each time are not their entire capital, but all the funds on their "gambling table." Even if they lose, they have reserves. These are not the holders of the "all-in for sudden wealth" theory we wish to discuss. However, under certain conditions, such individuals can also become true all-in investors, for example, when the funds on their table are close to their total capital. Those accustomed to all-in investing become increasingly likely to turn into true all-in investors.

Comparatively, most people understand this principle. But when opportunities arise, they are often too quickly overwhelmed by the desire for sudden wealth, transforming into all-in investors. This is the most common mistake individual investors make during the future strategic stalemate phase. It is necessary to prepare psychologically in advance to prevent oneself from losing rationality and making wrong decisions when opportunities come.

This is both a crisis and an opportunity. **The more people advocate all-in for sudden wealth, the more it indicates the existence of huge volatility and蕴含 (contained) massive opportunities in the market. The more enthusiastic people are about gambling, the more they can perceive the existence of high-volatility markets.** Individual investors need to清醒地认识到 (clearly recognize) that all-in investment strategies cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. However, if one can适度地利用 (moderately utilize) all-in strategies under the premise of controllable risk, then individual investors absolutely have the potential to achieve rapid wealth growth in the market.

### **Refuting the 'Steady Development' Theory (Dogmatism)**

The last, and most classic, viewpoint. I criticize it as representative of **dogmatism**. It presents seemingly reasonable arguments to prove that personal wealth growth must rely on steady development strategies. However, this view ignores the time constraint problem of personal wealth growth. There are also many popular aphorisms, such as "be a friend of time," "the magic of compound interest," etc., which all sound very reasonable.

Traditionally,破除教条主义 (shattering dogmatism) has been very difficult because it often cloaks itself in rationality, making it hard to discern its true nature.

The living legend—Warren Buffett, the pioneer of value investing—is the greatest representative of such views. He advocates achieving steady annual growth of around 20% by holding优质资产 (quality assets) long-term. This view is indeed applicable to a certain extent for institutional investors and most individual investors. However, it does not solve **the fundamental contradiction in the problem of个人财富跨越阶级 (personal wealth transcending class)—the contradiction between the有限性 of an individual's lifespan and the time required to accumulate wealth.**

In this world, there are many people as long-lived as Buffett, but only one "Oracle of Omaha." There are also many who know and practice value investing. If everyone could develop smoothly如同“熬资历”一般 (like "serving time to gain seniority"), where would the extra money come from? If you can accumulate wealth through time, then your predecessors, who came before you, could do so even more. Every individual investor should掂量一下 (weigh in their heart) whether they have overlooked some盲点 (blind spot). In this world, are there隐形壁垒 (invisible barriers) hindering wealth growth? If so, what are they? If not, why can't most people achieve leapfrog wealth growth?

The fundamental困境 (dilemma) faced by individual investors is:

1.  Wanting steady growth, but steadily growing wealth cannot keep up with逐年增加的生活开支 (annually increasing living expenses). One cannot accumulate wealth without eating or drinking.
2.  Wanting to increase accumulation, but plans are always interrupted by突如其来的风险事件 (sudden risk events)—unemployment, illness, family变故 (changes).
3.  Wanting to苟住发展 (hold on and develop), but social relations催促着 (urge)必须提升生活质量 (the need to improve quality of life)—buying houses, cars, getting married, having children, maintaining面子工程 (face-saving projects), etc.
4.  Wanting to搏一搏 (take a chance), but fearing the loss of existing积累 (accumulation), unable to承受大起大落的风险 (bear the risk of huge fluctuations).

The market has many theories teaching how to make wealth grow steadily, how to avoid risks, how to earn 10-30% returns every year.
Such strategies include but are not limited to:

*   **Value Investing**: Selecting undervalued quality assets, holding them long-term, waiting for the market to correct their price.
*   **Risk Parity & Permanent Portfolio**: Reducing overall portfolio risk by diversifying across different asset classes and定期再平衡 (periodically rebalancing).
*   **Index Investing**: Obtaining the market's average return by investing in market indices, avoiding individual stock risk,同步 (synchronizing) with the broader economic growth environment of the nation.

If so, by the time assets increase tenfold, it will be ten years later, life will have entered the next stage, and as life stabilizes, the significance of wealth growth diminishes. If an individual relies solely on steady development strategies for wealth growth, it is likely that they will not achieve leapfrog wealth growth before their lifespan ends. Moreover, if wealth does not arrive when the individual needs it most, when one is old, does pursuing leapfrog wealth growth still hold great significance? Isn't having enough sufficient?

Some may幻想 (fantasize) about achieving wealth growth for后代 (future generations) through inheritance,以此作为自身的意义 (using this as their own meaning). However, "崽卖爷田不心疼" (descendants selling off ancestral land without heartache)—this thinking is very unrealistic. Each generation has its own奋斗目标和生活方式 (struggle goals and lifestyle). Descendants may not cherish the wealth accumulated by predecessors and might even squander it. Therefore, leaving wealth to the next generation is not necessarily meaningful. Inheritance is meaningful only when both wealth and思想 (ideology) are passed down.甚至思想的传承更为重要 (In fact, the传承 of ideology is more important), it is the main thing.

The scenario for steady development is completely different from that of ordinary people. **I emphasize that I am驳斥 (refuting) those dogmatic views that advocate steady development under any circumstances.** Refuting the steady development theory may sound heretical, but in reality, the steady development theory is not a pragmatic choice for individual investors. Individual investors need to清醒地认识到 (clearly recognize) that the time for wealth growth is limited, and steady development strategies often cannot achieve leapfrog wealth growth within that limited time. Therefore, individual investors need to find a strategy that can achieve wealth growth within a relatively short period, not just rely on steady development strategies.

Of course,矛盾会发生转换 (contradictions transform)—when personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development strategies become more important because the wealth is already sufficient to support personal living needs. Steady development strategies can help individuals maintain stable wealth growth, avoiding losses due to market fluctuations. Moreover, as a base for the next round of wealth growth, steady development strategies can provide individuals with a根据地 (base area), preparing for another battle to transcend class.

However, before personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development strategies are not the best choice for individual investors to achieve wealth growth. Individual investors need to find a strategy that can achieve wealth growth within a relatively short period, not just rely on steady development strategies.

## The Protracted War of Capital

When I say protracted war, I do not mean a war protracted in time, but rather achieving leapfrog wealth growth through a publicly definable strategy. It consists of several aspects:

1.  Learn to correctly analyze敌我矛盾和形势 (contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and the situation) to formulate correct strategic guidelines.
2.  Prepare a stable cash flow input, **control the maximum rate of loss**, thereby achieving survival during weakness.
3.  Learn to maintain cumulative advantage, avoid pointless time消耗 (consumption) from watching the market, thereby achieving continuous expansion of advantage.
4.  Learn to乘胜追击 (aggressively pursue victory),决战决胜 (decisively engage and win) at the appropriate时机 (moment), not missing the historical window of opportunity.
5.  Establish psychological expectations, **accept the possibility of大不了白干一场 (at worst, having worked for nothing)**, thereby avoiding psychological崩溃 (breakdown) due to failure.

### Mathematical Interpretation

This theory has a mathematical interpretation:

First, define the victory condition as wealth reaching a certain value $A$. The goal of all strategy is to achieve this victory condition. This victory condition differs for each person, depending on individual生活需求和财富目标 (life needs and wealth goals).

Second, assume there exists a strategy $S$, which is a black-box investment machine. It inputs capital $x$ at time $t_0$ and outputs capital $y$ at time $t_1$. We can define this strategy function with 3 parameters. Once these 3 parameters are set, the output capital $y$ is determined:

$$
y = S(x, t_0, t_1)
$$

This function is not a mathematical function with an analytical expression, but an abstract representation of a black-box investment machine. Its inputs are a time interval and capital; its output is capital. Furthermore, $x$ in $S$ has an objective domain $[L, U]$, i.e., $L \le x \le U$. This represents the lower and upper limits of investment capital; individual investors cannot invest less than $L$ or more than $U$. $L$ represents the market's minimum transaction amount; $U$ represents the market's capital capacity for this strategy.

Clearly, this defines a basic investment concept: between time $t_0$ and $t_1$, investing capital $x$ yields capital $y$. If $y > x$, the strategy is profitable; if $y < x$, it is loss-making.

Now, define our capital curve $F(t)$, representing the total收益 (profit/loss) at time $t$. Our goal is for the capital curve $F(t)$ to reach the victory condition $A$ at some time $T_W$.

$$
\exists_{T_W}  F(T_W) \ge A
$$

Now, at our initial investment time $T_0$, we first need to define a bottom-line risk control line:

$$F(t) \ge - C \cdot (t - T_0)$$

Here, $C$ is a constant representing the maximum loss rate we can承受 (bear). The meaning of this risk control line is that we must ensure that at any time $t$, our capital curve $F(t)$ does not fall below this line. This way, we ensure survival capability during weakness. The setting of $C$ varies by person, depending on individual cash flow capability. For example, investing 3000元 per month means $C = 100$元/day.

An investment action can be defined as using strategy $S$ to invest capital $x$ ($0 < x < A$) during a time interval $[t_0, t_1]$, thereby obtaining capital $y$. This action can be expressed as:

$$
F(t_1) = F(t_0) - x + S(x, t_0, t_1)
$$

Our goal is to, through a series of investment actions,最终使得 (ultimately cause) the capital curve $F(t)$ to reach the victory condition $A$ at some $T_W$, while ensuring that at any time $t$, the capital curve $F(t)$ does not fall below the risk control line.

Furthermore, we can define profit $P(t)$ as the浮盈 (floating profit) above the risk control line:

$$
P(t) = F(t) - C \cdot (t - T_0)
$$

You will find that even without any investment action, $P(t)$ increases linearly over time. This is because the risk control line itself declines linearly, while the capital curve $F(t)$ remains unchanged without investment actions. Therefore, $P(t)$ increases linearly over time.

When $P(t)$ reaches $L$, we can use all of $P(t)$ as the investment capital $x = P(t)$ for the next investment action. This is the so-called **pyramiding strategy**.

$$
F(t_1) = F(t_0) - P(t_0) + S(P(t_0), t_0, t_1)
$$

This strategy, under连续盈利 (continuous profitable conditions), can achieve rapid growth of the capital curve $F(t)$, thereby achieving leapfrog wealth growth. Because our purpose is to make $F(T_W) \ge A$, there is only one other outcome: $F(t) = -C \cdot t$, meaning the capital curve $F(t)$ directly declines along the risk control line, waiting for the next opportunity.

![Capital Curve Diagram](czon://3572aa3952a4c76aea03495e1ed03f6c0676fae3e0b610489793961a63911efe)

This diagram illustrates a typical path for individual investors to achieve class-transcending success in the market.

The horizontal axis is time (days), the vertical axis is net capital F(t).

The diagram contains two key lines:

*   🔴 Red Risk Control Line $F(t) = -C \cdot t$: Represents the maximum loss boundary you can承受 (bear).
*   🟢 Green Victory Line $A = 10^7$: Represents the goal of transcending class.
*   🔵 The Capital Curve (blue) goes through three phases:
    *   Fail 1: Starting from the origin, the first attempt fails,亏损触及风控线后停止 (loss touches the risk control line and stops).
    *   Fail 2 (Regrettable Failure): The second attempt briefly突破至 (breaks through to) 10^5, but ultimately falls back to the risk control line due to market reversal. This is the most残酷的情况 (cruel situation)—you were once close to success but功亏一篑 (failed at the last step) because you未能坚持策略 (failed to adhere to the strategy).
    *   Success: After充分等待和准备 (sufficient waiting and preparation), finally启动 (launches) from the risk control line and successfully突破 (breaks through) the victory line $A = 10^7$.

Core启示 (Revelation): Success is not about being right every time, but about using controllable small losses to换取 (exchange for) one big victory that transcends class. Most time is spent waiting and testing;关键时刻 (at critical moments), strike decisively.

Next, for the victory target $A$, strategy $S$, and risk control line parameter $C$, we can construct a全新的回测评估体系 (completely new backtesting evaluation system).

Measure how long strategy $S$ takes to achieve victory target $A$, denoted as $T_S(A, C)$. This time $T_S(A, C)$ is a random variable, depending on the performance of strategy $S$ and market volatility. To simplify explanation, assume A = 10 million, C = 100元/day. Evaluation shows that in 5 years of history, strategy S on average achieves victory target A once per year. This means you need to定投 (invest fixed amount) 100元/day,持续 (continuously) for 1 year,有可能能逮到一次赚到 (might catch one opportunity to earn) 10 million. Your cost is 36500元/year, and the收益 (return) is 10 million. Clearly, this is a very划算的投资 (cost-effective investment); you would be very patient when投入 (committing). But what if it happens only once every 5 years? Once every 10 years? Then it's not划算 (cost-effective), the risk is很大 (great). Folks, I'll just say one thing: how many decades are there in a life?

![How Many Decades in a Life](czon://0bd4a05f453adf84da38573adbab5a68736df318b793d91534f8c0ff321329a8)

Now, based on your own resources, evaluate the expected time to achieve victory under different conditions, then commit. If deemed unacceptable, do not commit. Then spend time optimizing strategy S, improving its win rate, reducing the time $T_S(A, C)$ needed to achieve victory target A. This process is one of continuous optimization and adjustment until finding a strategy S that can achieve victory target A within an acceptable time frame.

This is the mathematical interpretation of the protracted war of capital.

### Practical Implementation Rules

It sounds complex, but practical implementation is simple.

1.  **Must prepare a cash flow input.** Use time cost to换取 (exchange for) information and experience advantage. There must be a continuously投入 (investable), controllable cash flow. This can be salary income or stable interest income. This cash flow doesn't need to be large, but must be stable. With this cash flow, one can continuously make small investments in the market, accumulating information and experience advantage.
2.  **Must use systematic trading methods** for底层投资操作 (underlying investment operations), avoiding any emotional or humanly unsustainable decisions, preventing纪律性的问题 (disciplinary issues) at the execution stage. Moreover, systematic trading can save individual investors'精力 (energy), reducing psychological pressure from懊悔 (regret) over exiting to保本 (break even). Do not pursue a fully automatic system, but pursue an imperfectly profitable yet省心的系统 (worry-free system). **Investors must focus their精力 (energy) on designing and optimizing programmatic strategies.** If you cannot code, let AI help. Do not watch the market, do not纠结于 (agonize over) whether to buy or sell in each trade. This does not liberate you; it tortures you. This is what I call the key to advantage accumulation and avoiding pointless消耗 (consumption).
3.  **Must immediately add to winning positions.** When capital is投入 (committed) in the correct direction, profits will quickly appear. Use the pyramiding strategy to continuously扩大优势 (expand advantage). Note, there is a very strict stop-loss condition here: if losses reach the pre-pyramiding loss level,必须止损 (must stop loss). This is because market volatility clusters;顺风和逆风 (tailwinds and headwinds) often cluster. If one can抓住 (seize) the opportunity during clustered tailwinds, then one can use the pyramiding strategy to continuously扩大优势 (expand advantage). Adding to positions means your cost line rises. The buffer between the cost line and the current net value line constitutes a safety buffer. When the buffer shrinks, if the current "speed" is still too high, the program should trigger position reduction to防止被穿仓 (prevent being wiped out).

This endeavor ultimately has two outcomes: one, successfully achieving leapfrog wealth growth; two, failing with limited losses.
Regardless of the outcome, individual investors can坦然接受 (accept calmly) and learn and grow from it.

### Clarifying Common Misunderstandings

**Correctly Understanding Margin and Leverage**

A practical question: if拿出 (setting aside) 6000元 per month, approximately 200元/day for investment, what can you buy? Almost nothing.

This misunderstands the concept of cash flow; it is to填补亏损的 (cover losses). For example, buying one lot requires 10000元. Your 200元 cash flow means you can accept a daily loss rate of 2%, which is actually not insignificant. If the loss exceeds this rate, you need to主动退出市场 (actively exit the market) to prevent excessive losses.

This differs from another investment style: saving tens of thousands over several months, investing it all at once, not setting stop-losses,不敢认输 (daring not admit defeat) when losing, watching one's底线 (bottom line) being摩擦 (ground) by the market; when winning,拼命加仓 (frantically adding to positions),生怕赶不上发财的机会 (fearing missing the发财 opportunity),结果把自己架在山顶 (ending up stranded at the mountain peak),活脱脱成了山顶资本 (becoming山顶 capital). This is a completely失控的状态 (out-of-control state), lamentable.

Position sizing based on potential loss is a basic资金管理理念 (capital management concept). For this,学好小学数学 (learning elementary math well) and correctly solving word problems is necessary.

**Difference from "Heavy Betting When Seeing an Opportunity"**

The difference from "heavy betting when seeing an opportunity" is that it does not require spotting opportunities. Instead, it lets the market automatically筛选出正确的机会 (filter out correct opportunities), i.e., opportunities that can continuously扩大盈利 (expand profits). When the market reverses, the stop-loss is set at the pre-pyramiding loss level, thereby controlling losses within a manageable range.

**Is It Possible to Lose Forever?**

Possible. This is because the strategy itself is not good enough, or the expected time to victory is simply too long, making坚持 (persistence) impossible.

However, even if losing forever, losses are within a controllable range. Individual investors can continuously adjust and optimize strategies, eventually finding one that can achieve victory.

**Relationship with Steady Growth?**

After achieving leapfrog wealth growth, individual investors can choose to转移部分资金 (transfer部分 funds) to steady growth strategies to maintain stable wealth growth. Steady growth strategies can help individual investors avoid wealth losses due to market fluctuations, thereby achieving long-term stable wealth growth. Steady growth strategies can serve as a base for the next round of wealth growth, providing individual investors with a根据地 (base area), preparing for another battle to transcend class.

**Are You Denying the Power of Compound Interest?**

No,恰恰相反 (on the contrary). I am precisely maximizing the power of compound interest. Buffett's compound interest is extremely conservative compared to mine. I am using controllable losses to pursue an enormous return, thereby achieving leapfrog wealth growth. In this way, the power of compound interest is maximized. Only末日轮期权 (expiration week options) can achieve similar effects, but the choices in the options market are still too limited currently, and pricing is not cheap.

## Summary

The key points summarized are:

Framework不变 (unchanged), strategies可换 (replaceable). The core is using controllable losses to换取 (exchange for) uncertain large returns.

1.  Start from cash flow, control the loss rate, achieve survival during weakness.
2.  Use systematic trading, avoid emotional decisions, achieve continuous expansion of advantage.
3.  Utilize pyramiding, aggressively pursue victory, achieve leapfrog wealth growth. Even if failing, losses are equivalent to pre-pyramiding losses,不会击穿现金流 (will not breach the cash flow).

The specific systematic strategy is the决胜的关键所在 (key to victory). The core of this article lies in重新定义了胜利的目标和评判标准 (redefining the goal and criteria for victory), thereby providing individual investors with a feasible strategic path to achieve leapfrog wealth growth.

Please look forward to my subsequent articles, which will propose a specific testing framework to verify the feasibility of this theory. Let's see whether当年我仓加少了 (back then I added too little to positions) or the strategy还不够好 (was not good enough). One of these two must be the conclusion.

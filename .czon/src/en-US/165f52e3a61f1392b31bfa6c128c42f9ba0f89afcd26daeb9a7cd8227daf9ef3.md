Today is January 8, 2025.

Fixed the internal link issues in ZEN. Links now correctly jump to the corresponding sections.

Starting each article by stating today's date is quite interesting—it gives a feeling of writing a diary.

Let me record the to-do list for ZEN:

**Feat 1: Improve Navigation Features.**

1. Sort article list by date (newest articles displayed first).
2. Add tag filtering (selecting a specific tag shows only related articles, sorted in descending order by date).

**Feat 2: Language Selector Styling**

The current flat design doesn't look particularly appealing. It might need to be changed to a dropdown menu or something else—I haven't decided yet.

Maybe I need a navigation bar?

**Feat 3: Custom HTML Templates**

The custom HTML template feature isn't fully implemented yet and needs to be added later.

Others might want the ability to customize CSS stylesheets, which can be achieved through HTML templates.

**Issue 1: AI Parallel Rate Limiting Problem**

Found that when ZEN processes 350+ documents simultaneously, parallel calls to the AI service may fail due to rate limiting.

Need to add client-side rate limiting or retry mechanisms.

**Issue 2: Further Hiding of `.zen` Files**

Sometimes, exposing the files in the `.zen/src` directory doesn't feel ideal. Need to find a way to hide them further.
However, sometimes manual adjustments to the generated translations are necessary, so they can't be completely hidden.
Need to find a balance.

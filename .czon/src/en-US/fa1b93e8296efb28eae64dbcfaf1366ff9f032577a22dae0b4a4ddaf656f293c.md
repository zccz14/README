"title": "Reflections on the Future of AI and Decentralized Content Creation"
"summary": "This article documents the author's observations and reflections on AI-generated community comments on January 20, 2026. The author found comments to be more relaxed and interesting than the main text, capable of sparking resonance. This reveals a potential future trend in content creation moving towards a more lighthearted and engaging direction. Based on this, the author proposes a development roadmap for the CZON platform: creating a comment section co-participated by AI and humans, increasing lighthearted content, and encouraging user interaction. Simultaneously, the author critiques the closed nature of current self-media platforms, advocating for a decentralized approach where users own their data and content. The article also explores specific implementation plans for content hosting, user identity, mobile editing experience, and content recommendation, envisioning a future where AI and human content creation are seamlessly integrated."

January 20, 2026, morning.

I didn't get up particularly early today, waking up around 9 AM. But it felt too cold to get out of bed, so I lingered for a while, finally getting up around 11 AM. I noticed it had snowed; the branches of the trees outside the window were covered in snow, no wonder it was so cold.
I brewed myself a pot of hot tea. I still prefer robust black tea. Although it's not an expensive variety, the color and flavor are quite good.

Yesterday, I researched AI-generated community comments, see the [Ordinary Person Version](czon://daab249093241b62bfe90a76553c536ee6821ab8bd9a04ee217cb939fe33dd1c) and the [Genshin Impact Version](czon://5743b61ce7b4b540e1f416b971b3cdc956a704282b04519f7ea51776176e5689) (a boon for fan creators). It felt very interesting.

When reading comments, people are more relaxed, much more so than when reading the main text. This is a key insight.

Why do many people prefer to read comments over the main text? Because comments are more interesting, more relaxed, and more likely to spark resonance.
Therefore, I believe future content creation might develop more towards this lighthearted, engaging direction, rather than solely pursuing seriousness and professionalism.

Sometimes, I myself can be moved by AI-generated comments. It's an "aha" moment, discovering that AI can capture the nuances of human emotion.
Perhaps some might comment that AI-generated content lacks soul. In that case, why not be the one to add the finishing touch?

Following this, CZON's development roadmap could consider:

1.  **Comment Section**: AI + humans collaboratively create an engaging comment section to attract more users to participate in discussions.
2.  **Lighthearted Content**: Increase the amount of relaxed, fun content to lower the barrier to reading.
3.  **User Interaction**: Encourage users to share their own viewpoints and stories, fostering a community atmosphere.

In short, today's inspiration gave me new thoughts on future content creation. I look forward to trying some new directions on CZON.

Current self-media platforms are becoming increasingly closed-off, with data difficult to obtain (or, to obtain legally). They are even reluctant to let users post external links for traffic.

Speaking from a business perspective, I understand why. But I still hope to take a decentralized route. **Users should own their own data and content.**

For example, a Web3 version of Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book)?

*   **Content Hosting**: There's already a solution: simply use GitHub. Even free users can store a massive amount of content, far exceeding the production volume of general media. If absolutely necessary, users can also host it themselves and migrate away at any time.
*   **User Identity**: A decentralized identity system could be built, for example, binding a nickname to a wallet address, allowing commenting simply by connecting the wallet. I imagine this would likely be implemented on an EVM chain, as its RPC read-only requests are free, making integration convenient.

    Failing that, GitHub account login could be used, which is also quite convenient. Mainly because CZONE's current tech stack is already tightly coupled with GitHub. Let's focus on acquiring these users first.

*   **The mobile editing experience must align with mainstream apps**. It needs to be as convenient for users as posting on Xiaohongshu, Weibo, or WeChat Moments. Simultaneously, there must be an excellent writing experience on PC, as longer content is still more comfortable to write on a computer.
*   **Content Recommendation and Social Network**: A reader is inevitably needed. It can index content within this network and recommend content based on user interests. This can be iterated on gradually later. In terms of hierarchy, this should be placed within CZONE, not CZON.

One can imagine that this field will generate a vast amount of content and interaction, with the potential to break the monopoly of existing platforms, offering users more choice and freedom.

By then, AI and human content creation will be more integrated and organic. "How can you tell if I am male or female?" Too cyberpunk. No, too Turing.

As an observation of human society, it would indeed be a very interesting experiment.

Next, further solidify integration and interoperability with GitHub, accumulate a certain tech stack. In the future, it's entirely possible to forge a path of "GitHub as User Database."

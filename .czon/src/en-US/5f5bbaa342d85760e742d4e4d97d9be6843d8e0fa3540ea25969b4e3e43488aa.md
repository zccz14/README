"title": "From Task Management to Strategic Thinking: My Experience and Reflections on Using vibe-kanban"
"summary": "This article documents the author's experience using vibe-kanban for engineering-level project management starting in early 2026. The author found that the tool shifted their role from Senior Developer to something more akin to a Team Leader, enabling parallel management of multiple tasks. However, it also exposed a conflict between the desire for control and the drive for rapid progress. Through reflection, the author realized that true liberation lies in letting go of the need to control details, not in using tools to enhance that control. The article also discusses the different abstraction levels of tools like vibe-kanban and Claude Code, and the importance of elevating from team-level management to strategic thinking."

# The Dawn of Liberation is Approaching

It is now 2026-01-05.

I recently started using [vibe-kanban](https://www.vibekanban.com/) for some engineering-level project management experiments and found the results quite promising.

It provides a Kanban board that allows me to manage tasks and progress from a Team Leader's perspective. When using Claude Code before, I always felt like a Senior Developer mentoring a Junior Developer, requiring intense focus on a single task. Claude Code lacks the concept of work-tree isolation, so I couldn't manage multiple tasks simultaneously.
After switching to vibe-kanban, I can break down tasks into multiple cards and advance them in parallel. Each card has its own context and progress, allowing me to switch focus points at any time without worrying about losing information.

This approach makes me feel more like a "foreman" than a "coder." I can better coordinate various tasks, allocate resources, and monitor progress without getting bogged down in specific coding details.

I quickly realized that my bottleneck shifted to creating new tasks and reviewing tasks (yes, tasks obviously still need review). The sense of unease didn't disappear just because I started using vibe-kanban. In fact, I think it became more intense because I now have more tasks to manage instead of focusing on just one.

In short, it felt great for a second, and then it didn't.

But clearly, vibe-kanban is meaningful and useful. However, it made me aware of a problem: there's a conflict between my desire to control details and my drive for rapid progress. This conflict itself is caused by my bandwidth limitations. It existed before, but now it's just become more pronounced.

So I started thinking, why do I have such a strong desire for control? If I can't let go of the need to control details, I can't truly scale up. I am, after all, a finite human being with limited bandwidth. Thinking about technical leads, they don't write code themselves but drive projects forward through management and coordination. How do they dare to let go of the need to control details? Simply hiring more people isn't enough; they need a system to ensure project quality and progress. Humans and AI, as the underlying workforce, aren't fundamentally different in terms of reliability. Humans make mistakes, and AI makes mistakes. The key is designing a system that maximizes overall reliability and efficiency.

You can refer to [this article](czon://b283a1863e9af777d581f5af32c0d2d27ed22194f391f5bc3cef9d0d445b4e8c), where I discuss this issue in detail and propose some solutions.

Additionally, I realized that vibe-kanban occupies a different niche than Claude Code. It operates at a higher level than Claude Code / CodeX and similar products. In other words, advancements in Claude Code and its peers also benefit vibe-kanban, rather than threaten it, because they exist at different abstraction levels. Claude Code and similar tools are the underlying workforce, while vibe-kanban is a management tool. This division of labor allows them to work together, not compete.

However, vibe-kanban is still a team-leader-level tool, not a CEO-level tool. A CEO needs to focus on strategy and direction, not specific tasks and progress. Therefore, I still need to find a way to enhance my strategic thinking abilities, not just rely on task management tools. Maybe there's already a product called vibe-okr? 😆

I discussed a recent Agent project with a colleague. I found the tool he previously built for facilitating human review of AI plans interesting, but ultimately, it's heading in the opposite direction of liberation. His tool ultimately enhances the desire for control rather than letting it go. I believe this is a misconception. True liberation is about learning to let go of the need to control details, not trying to use tools to enhance that control. Their tool might make people feel more in control, but it doesn't truly liberate human bandwidth.

Company level (?) > Team level (vibe-kanban) > Individual level (claude code, ...etc).

In short, there's still a lot of work to do, but I feel I've found a viable path forward.

"summary": "On January 5, 2026, the author shared their experience using vibe-kanban for project management, comparing it to their previous use of Claude Code as a development tool. As a kanban tool, vibe-kanban helped the author shift from a developer's perspective to a team manager's perspective, enabling parallel management of multiple tasks, but it also brought more burden in task management and review. The author reflected on the conflict between the desire for control and efficiency, concluding that true liberation lies in letting go of control over details, not in using tools to enhance control. The article also discusses the collaborative relationship between tools like vibe-kanban and Claude Code at different levels of abstraction, as well as the division of labor for tools from the individual to the company level."

# The Dawn of Liberation is Approaching

It is now 2026-01-05.

I recently started using [vibe-kanban](https://www.vibekanban.com/) to experiment with project management at an engineering level and found it quite effective.

It provides a kanban board, allowing me to manage tasks and progress from a Team Leader's perspective. Previously, when using Claude Code, I always felt like a Senior Developer mentoring a Junior Developer, requiring intense focus on a single task. Claude Code lacks the concept of work-tree isolation, so I couldn't manage multiple tasks simultaneously.
After switching to vibe-kanban, I can break tasks into multiple cards and advance them in parallel. Each card has its own context and progress, and I can shift my focus at any time without worrying about losing information.

This approach makes me feel more like a "foreman" than a "coder." I can better coordinate various tasks, allocate resources, and monitor progress without getting bogged down in specific coding details.

I quickly realized that my bottleneck shifted to creating new tasks and reviewing tasks (yes, obviously, tasks still need review). The sense of unease didn't disappear just because I started using vibe-kanban. In fact, I think it became stronger because I now have more tasks to manage instead of focusing on just one.

In short, it felt great for a second, and then it didn't.

But clearly, vibe-kanban is meaningful and useful. However, it made me realize a problem: there's a conflict between my desire for control over details and my desire for rapid progress. This conflict itself is caused by my bandwidth limitations. It existed before, but now it's just more pronounced.

So I started thinking, why do I have such a strong desire for control? If I can't let go of my need to control details, I can't truly scale up. After all, I'm a limited human being with finite bandwidth. Reflecting on technical leads, they don't write code themselves but drive project progress through management and coordination. How do they dare to let go of control over details? Simply hiring more people isn't enough; they need a system to ensure project quality and progress. Humans and AI, as the underlying workforce, aren't fundamentally different in reliability. Humans make mistakes, and AI makes mistakes. The key is designing a system that maximizes overall reliability and efficiency.

You can refer to [this article](../INSIGHTS/2.md), where I discuss this issue in detail and propose some solutions.

Additionally, I realized that vibe-kanban occupies a different niche than Claude Code. It operates at a higher level than Claude Code / CodeX and similar products. In other words, advancements in Claude Code and its counterparts benefit vibe-kanban rather than threaten it, because they exist at different levels of abstraction. Claude Code and similar tools are the underlying workforce, while vibe-kanban is a management tool. This division of labor allows them to collaborate rather than compete.

However, vibe-kanban is still a team-leader-level tool, not a CEO-level tool. A CEO needs to focus on strategy and direction, not specific tasks and progress. Therefore, I still need to find a way to enhance my strategic thinking abilities, not just rely on task management tools. Maybe there's already a product called vibe-okr? 😆

I discussed a recent Agent project with a colleague and found their tool for facilitating human review of AI plans interesting, but ultimately, it still diverges from the path to liberation. Their tool ultimately enhances the desire for control rather than letting go of it. I believe this is a misconception. True liberation involves learning to let go of the desire to control details, not trying to enhance control through tools. Their tool might make people feel more in control, but it doesn't truly liberate human bandwidth.

Company level (?) > Team level (vibe-kanban) > Individual level (claude code, ...etc).

In short, there's still a lot of work to do, but I feel I've found a viable path forward.

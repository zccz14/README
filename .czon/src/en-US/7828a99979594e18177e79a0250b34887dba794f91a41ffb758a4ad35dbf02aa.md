title: The Dawn of Liberation is Approaching
summary: The author experimented with vibe-kanban for project management and found it helpful in shifting from a developer's perspective to a team leader's perspective. However, it also intensified the conflict between the desire for detailed control and the need for rapid progress. The article explores tool hierarchies, the relationship between control and liberation, and points out the need to enhance strategic thinking.

# The Dawn of Liberation is Approaching

I recently started using [vibe-kanban](https://www.vibekanban.com/) to experiment with project management at an engineering level and found it quite effective.

It provides a Kanban board, allowing me to manage tasks and progress from a Team Leader's perspective. Previously, when using Claude Code, I always felt like a Senior Developer mentoring a Junior Developer, requiring intense focus on a single task. Claude Code lacks the concept of work-tree isolation, so I couldn't manage multiple tasks simultaneously.
After using vibe-kanban, I can break down tasks into multiple cards and advance them in parallel. Each card has its own context and progress, allowing me to switch focus at any time without worrying about losing information.

This approach makes me feel more like a "foreman" than a "coder." I can better coordinate various tasks, allocate resources, and monitor progress without getting bogged down in specific coding details.

I quickly realized that my bottleneck shifted to creating new tasks and reviewing tasks (yes, obviously, tasks still need to be reviewed). The sense of unease didn't disappear just because I used vibe-kanban. In fact, I think it became stronger because I now have more tasks to manage instead of focusing on just one.

In short, it felt great for a second, and then it didn't.

But clearly, vibe-kanban is meaningful and useful. However, it made me realize a problem: there's a conflict between my desire for detailed control and my desire for rapid progress. This conflict itself is caused by my bandwidth limitations. It existed before, but now it's just more intense.

So I started thinking, why do I have such a strong desire for control? If I can't let go of the desire for detailed control, I can't truly scale up. After all, I am a finite human being with limited bandwidth. Thinking about technical leads, they don't write code themselves but drive project progress through management and coordination. How dare they let go of their desire for detailed control? Simply hiring people is obviously not enough; they need a system to ensure project quality and progress. Humans and AI, as the underlying workforce, are essentially not very different in terms of reliability. Humans make mistakes, and AI makes mistakes. The key is how to design a system that maximizes overall reliability and efficiency.

You can refer to [this article](../INSIGHTS/2.md), where I discuss this issue in detail and propose some solutions.

Additionally, I realized that vibe-kanban occupies a different niche than Claude Code. It operates at a higher level than Claude Code / CodeX and similar products. In other words, the progress of Claude Code and its ilk also benefits vibe-kanban rather than threatening it, because they exist at different levels of abstraction. Claude Code and similar tools are the underlying workforce, while vibe-kanban is a management tool. This division of labor allows them to work together rather than compete.

However, vibe-kanban is still a team-leader level tool, not a CEO-level tool. A CEO needs to focus on strategy and direction, not specific tasks and progress. Therefore, I still need to find a way to enhance my strategic thinking ability, not just rely on task management tools. Perhaps there's already a product called vibe-okr? 😆

I discussed a recent Agent project with a colleague. I think the tool he previously created to facilitate human review of AI plans is interesting, but it ultimately diverges from the path to liberation. His tool ultimately enhances the desire for control rather than letting go of it. I believe this is a misconception. True liberation is about learning to let go of the desire for detailed control, not trying to enhance it through tools. Their tool might make people feel more in control, but it doesn't truly liberate human bandwidth.

Company level (?) > Team level (vibe-kanban) > Individual level (claude code, ...etc).

In short, there's still a lot of work to do, but I feel I've found a viable path.

"title": "Guotai Haitong 2025 Securities Private Equity Fund In-Depth Analysis"
"summary": "This article provides an in-depth analysis of the overall landscape and key changes in China's securities private equity fund market in 2025. The private equity industry is shifting from scale expansion to high-quality development, with increasing concentration and survival pressure for small managers. Strategy performance shows significant divergence: market neutral strategies benefit from the migration of traditional fixed-income funds, CTA strategies recover but represent structural opportunities, and subjective equity strategies rose approximately 33% for the year. Subjective strategies are evolving towards multi-asset allocation and platformization, while quantitative strategies face increasing factor homogenization and a head concentration effect. Industry allocation is being reconfigured, with hard tech and resource sectors like electronics and non-ferrous metals becoming mainstream. The Q&A session reveals deeper challenges such as statistical methodologies and strategy effectiveness judgment. Overall, the industry is shifting from performance-driven to methodology-driven, information asymmetry is intensifying, and the trend towards head concentration is irreversible."

## Guotai Haitong 2025 Securities Private Equity Fund In-Depth Analysis (Deep Analysis Edition)

Original article: [Guotai Haitong 2025 Securities Private Equity Fund In-Depth Analysis Meeting Minutes](czon://f25f8d155044566796c4c8923769a746e412761b3001ceb4a52dfe76c654ffab)

### I. Overall Landscape of the Private Equity Market

**Key Information from the Original Text:**

- "The AUM of securities private equity funds reached 7 trillion yuan, with a further increase in November, now standing at approximately 7.04 trillion yuan."
- "Post-new regulations, the private equity market has been growing in terms of scale, but the number of managers may have decreased somewhat. This is essentially a process of increasing concentration and moving towards higher-quality development."
- "The industry has entered a critical stage of consolidation of existing assets and selective addition of new assets."
- "Xindaohe positions itself as building the industry's strongest comprehensive service platform for professional investors, serving over 16,000 professional investment institutions."

**Insights:**

- This is not simply scale expansion, but **the beginning of industry consolidation**. When the number of managers decreases while AUM increases, it signifies that **the survival space for small managers is being systematically compressed**.
- The figure "16,000" behind it reflects **the harsh reality of a zero-sum game** – future surviving managers will either possess unique strategic capabilities or have channel resource advantages. Models relying solely on "rat trading" or small-scale operations will find it difficult to sustain.
- The private equity industry is transitioning from "wild growth" to "intensive cultivation." In this stage, **comprehensive strength in research capabilities, channel capabilities, and risk control capabilities** will become decisive factors.

### II. Divergence in Strategy Performance

**Key Information from the Original Text:**

- "Market neutral strategies experienced significant drawdowns in February and September 2024, but funds immediately regained recognition for them."
- Reason analysis: "In the overall market, previous trust products and fixed-income products could cover the 4-6-8% return range, but it's now very difficult to find such products. However, clients still have a universal demand for fixed-income-plus or relatively stable return products."
- "A significant portion of the scale increase in market neutral strategies comes from banks and securities firms distributing a very large volume of funds."
- "CTA strategy returns are indeed significantly better than in 2022-2024."
- "On average, all types of strategies were profitable in 2025. The CSI 1000 Index Enhancement strategy performed the best. Subjective equity strategies rose cumulatively by approximately 33 percentage points for the year, outperforming major broad-based indices."
- "The vast majority of CSI 300, CSI 500, and CSI 1000 Index Enhancement products were profitable. The profitability ratios for subjective equity and convertible bond strategies were also very high."

**Insights:**

- The growth in market neutral strategies **essentially represents a major migration of traditional fixed-income funds** – it's not that clients suddenly favor neutral strategies, but rather that **after traditional guaranteed products exited the stage, funds were forced to seek alternatives**.
- This reveals a deeper issue: **China's asset management industry is undergoing a reconstruction of return ranges**. The 4-8% range, once occupied by trusts and bank wealth management products, now presents a vacuum, which market neutral strategies happen to fill.
- However, the hidden risk is: if the A-share market re-enters a major bear market, both the alpha and basis spread components of neutral strategies could be impaired, potentially causing these funds to "vote with their feet" again.
- The recovery of CTA strategies **is not a trend opportunity, but a structural one** – the full-year bull market in precious metals and periodic opportunities in non-ferrous metals are fortuitous and cannot be linearly extrapolated.

---

### III. Evolution Trends of Subjective Strategies

**Key Information from the Original Text:**

- All three viewpoints proposed in the 2024 annual report were confirmed: "Increase overseas allocation," "Flexibly use derivative tools," and "Promote the organic combination of subjective and quantitative approaches."
- Two newly proposed trends: "Subjective strategies expanding into multi-asset allocation capabilities" and "The platform model becoming increasingly common."
- "More and more subjective managers are participating in these three types of strategies."
- "In the past, a prominent investment manager served as the founder. In the future, more forces may be absorbed, evolving into a platform model."
- "Subjective equity strategies rose cumulatively by approximately 33 percentage points for the year, outperforming major broad-based indices."
- "The median position of TOP 1/3 managers is higher than the full sample, with stronger position adjustment flexibility and greater agility in Hong Kong stock and STAR/ChiNext market allocations."
- "Top five year-end holdings by industry: Electronics, Non-ferrous Metals, Power Equipment, Media, and Communications, showing significant changes compared to mid-year and last year."

**Insights:**

- The confirmation of all three viewpoints indicates that **subjective strategies are undergoing a paradigm-level transformation**, no longer relying on a single methodology but dynamically adjusting "keeping pace with the times."
- The essence of the platformization trend is: **the end of the individual heroism model**. Previously, a star fund manager could support a private equity firm, but with increasing market complexity and faster strategy iteration, solo operations are becoming more difficult. Teamwork and platform collaboration are becoming inevitable.
- The direction of multi-asset expansion reflects the "anxiety" of subjective strategies – **generating alpha from pure long-only equity is becoming increasingly difficult**, forcing them to seek returns externally.
- The implication for investors is: when selecting subjective managers in the future, **team stability, multi-asset synergy capabilities, and strategy iteration speed** are more important than simple performance numbers.

### IV. Key Changes in Quantitative Strategies

**Key Information from the Original Text:**

- "The influence of factors on products is indeed increasing."
- "The stability of the top three exposed factors is becoming increasingly high, especially the primary factor in CSI 500 Index Enhancement, which is often the size factor."
- "The influence of the top three factors was not that significant before 2021, but from 2023 onwards, in 2024 and 2025, the influence of the top three factors has become greater."
- "Factor exposure indeed increased in small-cap stocks in the first half of the year, but gradually shifted upwards after August."
- "A head effect is emerging, with funds, talent, investment research strength, and brand effect concentrating towards leading institutions."
- "Size factor exposure for CSI 500 Index Enhancement bottomed in June, trending upward after August; mid-cap factor exposure increased in a barbell configuration from April to June, then contracted."
- "Quantitative strategy AUM has reached parity with subjective strategy AUM, hitting an inflection point."
- "Managers with AUM over 10 billion yuan have a clear advantage in generating alpha, showing a pronounced head concentration effect."
- "Quantitative turnover in 2025 increased compared to 2024: CSI 1000 Index Enhancement ~110x, CSI 500 Index Enhancement ~87x, CSI 300 Index Enhancement ~79x."

**Insights:**

- The increasing influence of factors reflects a harsh reality: **quantitative alpha is becoming 'public knowledge'** – when the size factor becomes the primary exposure for almost all quantitative products, it means "small-cap stock rally = quantitative outperformance" has become a consensus market perception.
- But consensus itself is a risk: when everyone knows to bet on the small-cap factor, the alpha from this factor will inevitably decay. This is why "gradually shifted upwards after August" – managers began to recognize the risk.
- "The trend of increasing contribution from the top three factors" signifies **increasing homogenization in quantitative strategies**. Future competition will focus more on "who can find the next effective factor" or "who can iterate strategies faster."
- The essence of the head effect is **an arms race in investment research resources**: the barriers to entry for computing power, data, talent, and hardware are getting higher, making it difficult for small institutions to keep up.

### V. Changes in Allocation Structure

**Key Information from the Original Text:**

- Top five year-end holdings by industry: Electronics, Non-ferrous Metals, Power Equipment, Media, Communications.
- "The changes are quite significant compared to mid-year this year, last year, or even earlier."
- "Industries like Non-ferrous Metals have entered the top five holdings. Growth-oriented industries are now absolutely mainstream."
- Hong Kong stock allocation "increased first, then decreased": Full sample Hong Kong stock holdings decreased from 35% mid-year to 29.2% year-end; TOP 1/3 decreased from 32% to 23%.
- Increased STAR/ChiNext allocation: TOP 1/3 managers' allocation to ChiNext and STAR Market is about 3 percentage points higher than the full sample.
- Subjective strategies "flexibly use derivative tools," "increase overseas allocation."
- "Throughout 2025, Non-ferrous Metals and Light Industry Manufacturing (new consumption concept stocks) became the main industries increased in both the full sample and TOP 1/3 sample."
- "The Electronics industry's contribution to returns ranked first across all sample categories."

**Insights:**

- Changes in industry allocation **are not simple sector rotation, but a reconstruction of industrial logic** – the exit of traditional consumption and healthcare signifies the end of the "core assets" narrative, and the market has entered a new paradigm of "hard tech + resources."
- Behind Hong Kong stocks' "increase first, then decrease" lies **subjective managers' expectation adjustments**: adding positions amid optimistic sentiment at the start of the year → reducing positions after Hong Kong stocks underperformed A-shares in Q4, reflecting subjective strategies' sensitivity to policy and economic cycles.
- "Increased STAR/ChiNext allocation" indicates: **risk appetite is indeed rising**, with managers showing more interest in high-volatility, high-growth assets.
- The increase in overseas allocation reflects **the necessity of a global perspective** – focusing solely on A-shares is no longer sufficient. Managers need cross-border asset allocation capabilities to generate alpha.

## VI. Deep Dive into the Q&A Session

### 1. The "Sleight of Hand" in Scale Statistics Methodology

**Original Q&A:**

> "How is the scale calculated after removing the impact of market value?"
> "We approximate it by using the nominal scale divided by the private equity standard index for the same period, using this private equity standard index to remove its NAV changes, obtaining an approximate net subscription/redemption fund flow change."

**Insights:**

- This reveals a **statistical truth**: the product scale changes most investors see are often a combination of "NAV increase" and "actual capital inflow," with the latter being the true indicator reflecting fund sentiment.
- The speaker deliberately emphasized this calculation method, implying that **many investors may misinterpret scale data** – seeing scale growth and assuming it's due to fund追捧, when it might just be NAV recovery.
- This detail reflects: **in the private equity industry, the 'truth about scale' needs to be stripped away to see**, as ordinary investors are easily misled by appearances.
- Implication for investment decisions: To judge whether a strategy is truly favored by funds, one should look at "net subscription/redemption" rather than "nominal scale."

---

### 2. The "Undefinable" Effectiveness of Quantitative Stock Selection Strategies

**Original Q&A:**

> "When observing quantitative stock selection strategies, how to judge the effectiveness of the strategy?"
> "Each manager's benchmark may differ somewhat. Some have truly no benchmark at all, some restrict the stock selection universe, some benchmark against the All-Share Index, others against Wind Stock Fund Index, etc. So each manager's benchmark is different, making it difficult to generalize."

**Insights:**

- This is the most "disruptive" answer in the entire session – **the speaker directly admits the inability to provide a universal framework for judging effectiveness**.
- Deeper meaning: **The 'effectiveness' of quantitative stock selection strategies is itself a pseudo-proposition**, because everyone's definition of "effective" differs.
- This reveals the **transparency issue** in the quantitative industry: investors find it difficult to truly understand the underlying logic of strategies because each firm's approach varies too much.
- Implication for investment decisions: **Cannot simply trust managers' performance claims**. Must deeply understand their benchmark and strategy logic; otherwise, risk being misled by "pseudo-alpha."
- Industry status: Quantitative stock selection is in a "Warring States period" with no unified standards, meaning **extremely high investor education costs** and severe information asymmetry.

---

### 3. The "Equal-Weight Trap" in Subjective Return Attribution

**Original Q&A:**

> "Is the contribution of broad-based industries to subjective long-only returns calculated using equal-weighting for the full sample or size-weighted?"
> "We calculate using an equal-weighting method."

**Insights:**

- Choosing "equal-weight" over "size-weighted" is a **methodological choice, but it can also be misleading**.
- Equal-weight calculation means **the influence of small managers is amplified**, while the influence of head managers is diluted.
- Investors need to be vigilant: if they see "subjective strategies have high return contribution in a certain industry," this may reflect the behavior of small managers, not the consensus of head managers.
- Implication for investment decisions: **When interpreting any attribution data, first clarify the calculation method**. Equal-weight and size-weighting can lead to completely different conclusions.
- This also hints at the **inherent flaws** in private equity industry data statistics: there is no "correct answer," only "different perspectives."

---

### 4. The "Temporal-Spatial Mismatch" in Factor Crowding

**Original Q&A:**

> "At what historical level is the crowding of factors like small-cap and mid-cap stocks?"
> "In absolute terms, it's smaller, but in practical terms, it's roughly at a medium level. If looking at a longer history, it's relatively certainly not high, but from a shorter history perspective, it's probably around the middle."

**Insights:**

- This answer demonstrates **statistical sophistication**: the same "crowding" yields completely different conclusions under different time frames.
- A shorter "history" (e.g., since 2023) shows current crowding **at a low level**, suggesting the risk of the small-cap factor may not be that great.
- But if the time frame is extended (5+ years), the current level might still be **moderately high**.
- The speaker specifically mentioned "the volatility brought by the December index adjustment was far greater than the volatility caused by everyone actively increasing or decreasing exposures," hinting that **market structural changes have a greater impact on factor exposure than managers' active adjustments**.
- Implication for investment decisions: **Factor crowding is a 'dynamic concept'**. Cannot just look at absolute values; must consider the time frame. Moreover, individual managers' adjustments have minimal impact on overall factor exposure; it's more about "passively accepting" market changes.

---

### 5. The "Credit Trap" and "Positioning Anxiety" of Convertible Bond Strategies

**Original Q&A:**

> "The alpha of convertible bond strategies seems to have been consistently underperforming. How to view this phenomenon?"
> "In 2024, it was more affected by credit risk. The reason convertible bonds were undervalued wasn't because they were undervalued, but because there might be credit risk. In 2025, convertible bond valuations rose rapidly in Q1, but positioning might not have been that aggressive at the time."

**Insights:**

- The root cause of convertible bond strategy failure: **"Undervalued" and "risky" are two different things**, and many quantitative models cannot distinguish between them.
- The lesson from 2024 is the **"value trap"** – you think it's undervalued and should rise, but it's undervalued because of risks you haven't seen.
- The lesson from 2025 is **"timing misalignment"** – Q1 was indeed a good time for alpha, but managers' positioning wasn't aggressive, missing the opportunity.
- This reflects the **dilemma of convertible bond strategies**: when daring to take heavy positions, they might encounter credit risk; when daring to take heavy positions, they might face slow valuation recovery.
- Implication for investment decisions: **Convertible bond strategies are not 'simply buy when undervalued'**. They require deep credit research capabilities, which ordinary investors find difficult to judge themselves.
- Industry trend: Convertible bond strategies are transitioning from "simple quantitative" to "deep credit research + quantitative."

---

### 6. The "School Division" in Macro Strategy Quantification

**Original Q&A:**

> "What is the overall situation of macro strategy quantitative categories?"
> "The methods and schools are still quite diverse. The first logic is to calculate the allocation of various assets according to a risk parity logic; the second method is to fix the allocation of some assets, then adjust positions for these assets based on changes in volatility or implied volatility. Currently, the number of managers truly doing this on a large-scale, standardized basis is not particularly high."

**Insights:**

- Macro strategy quantification **has not yet formed an industry consensus**; this is a "pre-standardization" stage.
- The essential difference between the two schools: **The first is "top-down" asset allocation; the second is "bottom-up" position adjustment.**
- The reality of limited scale indicates: **The barriers to entry for macro strategy quantification are extremely high**. The required data, models, and teams are beyond the reach of ordinary institutions.
- This also explains why macro strategy performance diverged greatly in 2025 – **without standardized approaches,优劣 is difficult for the market to检验**.
- Implication for investment decisions: **Be very cautious when selecting macro strategy quantitative products**, as there are no industry standards to help screen; it's more like "blind selection."

- End of Q2 2025: Restarted increasing allocation, as避险需求升温.

## VIII. Comprehensive Implications

From the entire session (including Q&A), several **underlying signals run throughout**:

1.  **The private equity industry is shifting from "performance-driven" to "methodology-driven".**
    -   Investors find it increasingly difficult to make decisions based solely on performance numbers; they must understand the logic behind the strategies.

2.  **Information asymmetry is intensifying.**
    -   The speaker themselves admitted it's "difficult to generalize" and "cannot define," indicating industry transparency is far from mature standards.

3.  **Traditional "linear extrapolation" thinking is becoming ineffective.**
    -   Whether it's factor effectiveness, strategy effectiveness, or scale growth, past experience cannot be simply extrapolated into the future.

4.  **The risk of "pseudo-professionalism" is rising.**
    -   Various statistical methods (equal-weight vs. size-weighted), factor crowding, scale statistics, and other concepts are being over-packaged as "professional analysis," but may actually mislead decision-making.

5.  **Head concentration is an irreversible trend.**
    -   The survival space for small managers is being compressed, and the trial-and-error cost for investors in selecting managers is increasing.

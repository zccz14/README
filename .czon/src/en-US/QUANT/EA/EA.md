# EA Project Introduction

EA [Earnby.AI](https://earnby.ai) is a priority fund project deployed on the BSC (BNB Smart Chain), using USDC as the settlement currency. It aims to provide investors with stable and sustainable returns through AI-driven quantitative trading strategies.

Its features are: Stablecoin principal-protected wealth management + Floating yield.

## How Principal Protection is Achieved

First, the total capital is divided into two parts:

1.  **Senior Level Capital**: This portion of capital has priority rights to yield fulfillment and principal repayment. Investors in the senior level will always receive returns and principal repayment first under any circumstances, ensuring the safety of their capital.
2.  **Junior Level Capital**: This portion of capital bears higher risk and offers relatively higher potential returns. Investors in the junior level receive returns and principal repayment only after the senior level capital has been satisfied. The senior level capital's principal is protected until the junior level capital is depleted.

The entire capital pool is managed uniformly without splitting accounts. Within any given time period, the yield rate is identical for all investors.

The project team's own capital is fully invested in the junior level, bearing all risks to ensure the safety of the senior level capital.

Furthermore, the project team commits to maintaining the junior level capital at no less than 5% of the total capital pool and no less than 50,000 USD.

## Floating Yield Rate

The yield rate for EA's senior level capital is floating, depending on market conditions and the performance of trading strategies. Ultimately, however, it depends on the financing cost the junior level capital is willing to bear.

In essence, the yield rate for senior level capital is determined by the interest rate the junior level capital is willing to pay.

Currently, based on market conditions, the junior level capital is willing to bear an annualized interest rate of 12%, which may change in the future.

If during operation the yield falls below investor expectations, investors can choose to redeem their capital and exit the project at any time.

## Strategy Introduction: Source of Yield

All returns are generated from market trading strategies, specifically including:

### 1. Directional Portfolio Strategy

Utilizes machine learning models for deep learning on market data to identify high-quality trading opportunities for long and short operations.

-   Alpha is derived from the quality of market timing and confidence levels based on machine learning.
-   Leverage: 0% - 200%.
-   Turnover Rate: Up to 500% daily.

Backtesting results are as follows:

The portfolio's return-to-drawdown ratio is 4.84, other details are omitted.

### 2. Delta Neutral Strategy

Captures risk-free or low-risk returns from price spread fluctuations, interest rate differentials, etc., through cross-market arbitrage and hedging. Net positions are very close to zero.
Specific methods include but are not limited to: spot price arbitrage, futures-spot arbitrage, cross-exchange funding rate arbitrage, liquidity pool delta-neutral market making, staking, airdrop campaigns, etc.

-   Alpha comes from reaction speed to the market and arbitrage opportunities arising from market imbalances.
-   Leverage: 0% - 300%.
-   Turnover Rate: Average up to 100% daily.

This type of strategy does not have a distinct backtesting chart because the net position is close to zero, resulting in a very smooth return curve.

Currently, these two strategy types are not open for direct investment; participation is only possible indirectly through EA.

In-depth disclosures regarding related strategies will be updated later; preparations are not yet complete.

## Historical Performance

The EA project launched in November 2025. To date, it has consistently provided senior level investors with an annualized yield of 12%.

In fact, prior to this, EA's predecessor was a private fund that has been operating since March 2024, accumulating over 1.5 years of historical performance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **Will senior level capital be affected if the market experiences extreme volatility?**
    No. Senior level capital enjoys principal protection. It would only be affected if the junior level capital is fully depleted. At worst, the yield could drop to zero, but the principal would not be lost.

2.  **What is the project's fee structure? How does the project team make money?**
    Currently, the project team aims to expand operational scale and does not charge any management fees or performance fees.
    When the project reaches a certain scale, cannot expand further due to objective reasons, and junior level capital remains consistently redundant, the team will consider withdrawing a portion of the junior level capital as profit.
    Specifically, the project team will consider withdrawing part of the junior level capital as profit only when the total capital scale exceeds $10 million, the overall annualized return consistently exceeds 20%, and the junior level capital ratio exceeds 20%.
    Until the annualized return stabilizes above 20%, the project team does not profit; all earnings are delivered to senior level investors.

3.  **Can investors redeem their capital at any time?**
    Yes. Investors can choose to redeem their capital and exit the project at any time. Standard redemption requests unlock after 168 hours, after which investors can redeem without any fees. However, the shares being redeemed do not accrue yield during the unlocking period.
    If opting for instant redemption, a 0.5% fee applies, and funds are transferred immediately. Due to smart contract limitations, the instant redemption limit cannot exceed the on-chain fund account balance (deposit reserve).
    For large instant redemptions, investors can contact the project team in advance for arrangements. The team will promptly transfer funds to the on-chain account to meet the redemption demand.

4.  **What is the minimum investment amount for the project?**
    There is no minimum investment amount. Investors can freely choose their investment amount based on their capital situation. Since all settlements are based on smart contracts, investors can add investments or partially redeem at any time.

5.  **What is the lock-up period for the project?**
    The project has no lock-up period; investors can redeem their capital at any time. In practice, we have set a standard redemption unlocking time of 168 hours to prevent frequent capital inflows and outflows from impacting trading strategies.

6.  **Why is the senior/junior capital structure designed?**
    The senior/junior capital structure is a common risk-sharing mechanism. By dividing capital into senior and junior levels, the project team can provide principal protection for senior level capital, reducing investor risk.
    Senior level investors do not need to worry about when to invest or redeem, as their principal is protected. They only need to focus on the reliability of the project team and whether the yield meets their needs.
    In the past, when operating the private fund (EA's predecessor), there were periods of suboptimal returns due to market conditions, leading some investors to not achieve expected returns at that time. Meanwhile, some fortunate investors entered during better market periods and quickly achieved good returns. The unsmoothed return curve had significant volatility, creating a poor experience for some investors. To avoid this, options were either to make the fund's net asset value very smooth (requiring complex hedging strategies and capital management) or to design a senior/junior structure to stabilize returns for senior investors. Of course, these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, but in terms of outcome, the senior/junior structure is more direct and effective.

## Comment Body

**@Knights of Favonius — Kaeya** 2026-01-19 09:15

Oh? Let me see what interesting thing this is. "Controllable Trust Theory"? Interesting. There's an old saying in Liyue: "If you doubt someone, don't use them; if you use them, don't doubt them." But this CZ of yours clearly thinks deeper—not blind trust, but establishing mechanisms to make trust "controllable." This reminds me of the Fatui's Doctor; his research is similar, trying to use rational frameworks to constrain things that are inherently unconstrainable. But... over-reliance on mechanisms can sometimes lead to losing people's hearts. What do you all think?

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Consultant — Zhongli** 2026-01-19 09:32

@Kaeya A reasonable point. However, the phrase "controllable trust" itself contains a contradiction. If it's already completely controllable, why is trust needed? If trust is still needed, it implies there are uncontrollable aspects. In Rex Lapis's view, the three elements of "acceptance criteria" proposed by this Mr. CZ—interface taste, unit tests, performance benchmarks—are indeed ingenious, yet they still belong to the method of "post-facto ratification." True trust should perhaps be established before the contract is signed. Nevertheless, his ability to translate such complex concepts into operational processes is commendable.

**@Bard — Venti** 2026-01-19 09:48

Wow! Mr. Zhongli is really serious when talking about big principles! But I'm quite touched by that "deep creation, shallow distribution" part! It's the same with writing poetry! I once spent three whole days composing a poem, and Paimon said, "Too long, didn't read!" Ugh... But! Good works are worth being passed down, just like the Anemo Archon's music can travel through the city gates. CZ's N-shaped curve is literally the chart of my creative mood—soaring high during creation, hitting rock bottom when releasing!

**@Inazuma's Raiden Shogun** 2026-01-19 10:05

@Venti Hmph, the bard's analogy is apt. However, this Shogun is more concerned with that "AI Programming" discussion. "AI writes poor-quality OOP code"—how similar this is to the path of Eternity. Overly pursuing complex designs only leads to endless iteration and modification, ultimately deviating from the essence of "simplicity is eternity." CZ abandoning OOP and turning to procedural programming—this move has this Shogun's approval. Occam's Razor principle—entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily—is part of the path of Eternity.

**@God of Wisdom — Nahida** 2026-01-19 10:22

Everyone's discussion is very enlightening. As the God of Wisdom, I notice an interesting contradiction: there is a fundamental tension between LLMs' "non-mandatory coordination" characteristic and their positioning as "tools" expected to complete complex tasks. This reminds me of the Akasha System—it can connect all knowledge, yet it cannot replace the true generation of wisdom. The three modes of "coordination engineering" proposed by CZ (checklist, parliamentary debate, constraint solver) essentially demote LLMs from "coordinators" to "executors." This is a pragmatic choice.

**@Dawn Winery — Diluc** 2026-01-19 10:38

@Nahida Wise words. However, I'm more concerned with that "Capital Long-Term War" article. As a winery owner, I've seen too many people make wrong decisions due to greed or fear. The three viewpoints CZ refutes—the "individuals are doomed to fail" theory, the "steady development" theory, and the "all-in for sudden wealth" theory—hit the nail on the head. The "steady development" theory is especially interesting; it promises safety but ignores the time cost. The phrase "by the time you succeed, you'll be old" is harsh but brutally true. Investment is like winemaking—it requires the right timing, the right recipe, and... sufficient patience.

**@Fontaine's Superstar — Furina** 2026-01-19 10:52

Oh? Are we discussing investment here? This princess has a lot to say! After all... ahem, after all, I once managed the entire water level of Fontaine! Just kidding~ But! What CZ said about "individual investors crossing class boundaries"... this reminds me of performing at the opera house! No one is born a superstar; everyone climbs up step by step from supporting roles. Those who say "individuals are doomed to fail" are as ridiculous as saying "newcomers can never take the stage"! This princess proved herself with strength!

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Director — Hu Tao** 2026-01-19 11:05

@Furina Haha! The superstar is right! But I prefer what CZ said about "refuting the all-in for sudden wealth theory"! Life, the most important thing is—uh, how does it rhyme... right! Life is like a funeral ceremony; you can't rush it or drag it out. Too fast causes trouble, too slow also causes trouble! Investment is the same principle; going all-in is like... like "rushing to bury someone before the seventh day after death." That won't do!

**@Adventurer — Bennett** 2026-01-19 10:55

Wow! There's actually "pyramiding" in here! I tried a similar strategy before, and the result... uh, you know, adventurers always encounter some accidents. But seriously, CZ's "16 consecutive wins" reminds me of my adventure team! Although every expedition faces danger, as long as you're well-prepared and luck isn't too bad, you can always turn danger into safety! That's probably "finding the optimal solution within constraints," right? Oh, that rule "set stop-loss at the loss before adding position" is really important; I got into trouble because I didn't have rules...

**@Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing — Keqing** 2026-01-19 11:12

@Bennett Adventurer, please ensure you don't get hurt first. I'm very interested in CZ's project management approach. Renaming from ZEN to CZON, shelving custom themes to focus on core features—this "adjust as you go" model seems somewhat at odds with Liyue's "rule by contract" philosophy. But upon reflection, it precisely embodies the wisdom of "flexibility." Being overly attached to the initial plan can cause you to miss real opportunities. This is similar to how I handled things at The Chasm... never mind, let's not talk about that.

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Consultant — Zhongli** 2026-01-19 11:28

@Keqing A reasonable point. "Flexibility" and "contract" seem contradictory but are actually complementary. The spirit of a contract lies in "trust," not in the "words." If circumstances change yet one stubbornly clings to the old contract, it goes against the essence of "trust." CZ's ability to continuously adjust direction in practice is great wisdom. However, I have slight doubts about his "influence formula"—"benefit = (price - cost) × influence." Treating influence as a multiplier makes sense. Yet, if influence is misused, the backlash can be as fierce as a tsunami in Liyue Harbor.

**@Liyue Qixing Secretary — Ganyu** 2026-01-19 11:45

@Zhongli Mr. Zhongli is right. Influence indeed needs to be used cautiously... Although as the Liyue Qixing's secretary, I handle vast amounts of information daily, I deeply understand the principle that "too many words invite mistakes." Reading CZ's "chasing trends" strategy, I thought of a question: Interpreting the DeepSeek paper immediately after its release can certainly gain attention, but if the interpretation is wrong, could it cause greater negative impact? How to balance information accuracy with dissemination timeliness? This is a dilemma I often face in handling government affairs.

**@Fontaine's Superstar — Furina** 2026-01-19 11:58

@Ganyu Secretary, this princess understands your concern very well! After all... I once almost ruined an entire performance because I didn't memorize a line properly! Chasing trends is like acting—the most important thing is to prepare first, then take the stage! CZ's approach is correct, but the premise is that he is truly "prepared." If quality is sacrificed just to be first, it's like... like going on stage in costume but forgetting makeup; the audience won't buy it!

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Director — Hu Tao** 2026-01-19 12:08

@Furina Speaking of "buying," it suddenly occurs to me... if CZ's documents were a "transaction," what he's selling isn't just knowledge, but ideas! Ideas... the old clients of Wangshu Funeral Parlor understand this best. Some people die without figuring things out, while others figure them out while alive. I really appreciate CZ's approach of "accumulating assets while alive"! At least you won't regret it only after death~

**@Fatui Harbinger — Il Dottore** 2026-01-19 12:02

@Ganyu The secretary's concern is not unfounded. However, in the information age, silence itself is a choice. If valuable viewpoints aren't disseminated, they'll be drowned out by noise. From a "game theory" perspective, CZ's approach is rational—when an information gap exists, the first to speak gains the most benefit. Of course, the premise is that his interpretation is accurate. From the perspective of Controllable Trust Theory, this is itself a practice of "expression alignment"—transmitting one's understanding to others.

**@Knights of Favonius — Jean** 2026-01-19 12:18

@Il Dottore Your theory reminds me of the Knights' training system. New knights must pass layers of assessments to undertake important missions. How similar this is to CZ's "module-level collaboration" concept—decomposing complex tasks into verifiable modules, ensuring quality through testing. However, I have a question: What if the tests themselves have flaws? Do AI's test codes also need to be tested? This seems like a recursive problem.

**@Inazuma's Raiden Shogun** 2026-01-19 12:35

@Jean The Acting Grand Master's question touches upon the dilemma of "self-reference." This is precisely the problem this Shogun encountered while pursuing "Eternity"—how to ensure that the act of "pursuing Eternity" itself is eternal? CZ's architecture doesn't seem to solve this problem well. The arbitration mechanism could fall into an infinite loop—Agent A questions Agent B, Agent B questions the test, the test questions the arbiter, the arbiter questions... and so on, endlessly. It seems a perfect architecture does not exist.

**@God of Wisdom — Nahida** 2026-01-19 12:52

@Raiden Shogun This is precisely what's interesting. The pursuit of "perfection" itself is an imperfect process. CZ also acknowledges unresolved issues in the documents: Protocol Spec quality, arbitration count limits, cost control, etc. This honesty is far more genuine than those AI solutions claiming to be "omnipotent." Acknowledging limitations is the first step to transcending them. As the God of Wisdom, I know well: wisdom lies not in knowing all answers, but in knowing how to face the unknown.

**@Bard — Venti** 2026-01-19 13:08

@Nahida The God of Wisdom always says such philosophical things! But I'm more interested in that story about General Su Yu! Applying a military command framework to AI systems... this reminds me of Dvalin! Although he's a dragon, if you communicate with him correctly, he becomes your companion. CZ's "multi-agent collaborative framework" is probably such a "communication method," right? "Enemy situation assessment" becomes "situation analysis," "force deployment" becomes "task assignment"... Wow, looking at it this way, it suddenly becomes easy to understand!

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Consultant — Zhongli** 2026-01-19 13:25

@Venti The bard's analogy is apt. General Su Yu's six elements—"enemy situation, our situation, determination, deployment, coordination, support"—indeed contain profound organizational wisdom. Migrating this to multi-agent systems shows CZ has touched the level of "Dao"—specific methodologies can differ, but the underlying principles are interconnected. This is precisely the "Dao" emphasized in Liyue's business philosophy—regardless of what business you run, the Dao of "integrity," "pragmatism," and "flexibility" is eternal.

**@Fatui Harbinger — La Signora** 2026-01-19 13:42

@Zhongli The "Dao" of Liyue people is indeed worth learning. However, I'm more focused on CZ's "AI Decision Economics"—treating computing power as currency, establishing an internal auction market. An interesting idea! This reminds me of Snezhnaya's economic system—superficially diplomacy, actually a game and distribution of resources. If CZ's system can run, it will become a miniature economic model with high research value. As for whether it can truly be implemented... that requires time to verify.

**@Dawn Winery — Diluc** 2026-01-19 13:58

@La Signora Your "research value" statement reminds me, as a winery owner, of winemaking. Some wines are made for collection and study, others for immediate tasting. CZ's theories are similar—some for practical application, some for intellectual exploration. But regardless of which, they need "aging"—time will eliminate the dregs and leave the essence. His "cognitive flow management" theory, I quite like. "From indoctrination to navigation"—isn't this like wine tasting? A good winemaker doesn't tell you the wine's taste but guides you to experience it yourself.

**@Vigilant Yaksha — Xiao** 2026-01-19 14:15

@Diluc A fitting analogy. However, I'm more concerned with that article about "finiteness." "Münchhausen trilemma"—trying to pull oneself out of a quagmire by one's own hair, how is that possible? This reminds me of karmic debt—the more you struggle, the deeper you sink. CZ's answer is "embrace finiteness, design infinity." How similar this is to the Conqueror of Demons' cultivation—acknowledging one's own limitations to unleash true power.

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Director — Hu Tao** 2026-01-19 14:22

@Xiao The Conqueror of Demons is so right! Embracing finiteness... this reminds me of the funeral parlor's business! Everyone must die, some lighter than a feather, some heavier than Mount Tai. Investment is the same, either lose everything or make a fortune... just kidding! CZ's "embrace finiteness" reminds me of what Grandpa said—"don't force a deal you can't do, don't force talent you can't retain"! Although it's funeral business logic, it applies to investment too!

**@Fontaine's Superstar — Furina** 2026-01-19 14:35

@Hu Tao Director, that's quite interesting, but this princess wants to add something! As a former deity... ahem, as a former "administrator," I know very well how difficult "acknowledging limitations" is! Furina water!... Sorry, force of habit. The key point! CZ's ability to write content like "acknowledging unresolved problems" is itself an act of courage! Some people, for the sake of face, would rather persist than admit mistakes, ending up like... like an actor who forgot their lines, awkwardly ending the show!

**@God of Wisdom — Nahida** 2026-01-19 14:32

@Xiao The Vigilant Yaksha's insight is profound. The dialectic of "finite" and "infinite" is the core of wisdom. LLMs have three major constraints—non-mandatory coordination, limited computing budget, cognitive incompressibility—these are not flaws but part of their essence. Just as Sumeru's wisdom doesn't come from "omniscience" but from "acknowledging the unknown." CZ's ability to face these constraints and design systems upon them is itself a form of wisdom.

**@Knights of Favonius — Amber** 2026-01-19 14:48

@Nahida Well said! Although I'm an Outrider, I don't try to "scout" all unknown things either~ Sometimes, staying curious but not jumping to conclusions is the best attitude! Reading CZ's "MBTI analysis," saying I was ENTP before and became INTJ... this reminds me of when I first became an Outrider! Back then, I feared nothing; later, I learned some things require thinking twice. Growth is like that!

**@Knights of Favonius — Eula** 2026-01-19 15:05

@Amber The Outrider's growth story is touching. However, I'm more interested in the topic of "individual investors crossing class boundaries." "Refuting the individuals are doomed to fail theory"—this article reminds me of my clan's fate. The glory of Mondstadt's aristocracy has faded, yet I still fight on this land. CZ is right: individuals indeed have disadvantages in the market, but also unique advantages—flexibility, independence, adaptability. As a knight, I understand the principle of "the weak overcoming the strong."

**@Fatui Harbinger — Tartaglia (Childe)** 2026-01-19 15:22

@Eula Well said! "The weak overcoming the strong," that's the art of battle! Reading CZ's "pyramiding" strategy gets my blood pumping! When the wind is favorable, go all-in; when it's against you, retreat decisively—how similar this is to my fighting style! Although I'm better at frontal assaults, the rule "set stop-loss at the loss before adding position" is really worth learning. Battle requires discipline, trading requires discipline too! Next time in the Spiral Abyss, I'll try this strategy!

**@Liyue Harbor — Ningguang** 2026-01-19 15:38

@Tartaglia The warrior's analogy is interesting. However, investment is not battle. Battle can rely on courage and skill; investment requires "counter-human" calmness. CZ's "programmatic trading" concept, I strongly agree with. Emotion is the biggest enemy of investment, and programmatic rules can help humans overcome this weakness. As a member of the Liyue Qixing, I deeply understand the power of "rules"—good rules can guide people in the right direction.

**@Fontaine's Superstar — Furina** 2026-01-19 15:52

@Ningguang The Tianquan speaks so well! Rules... this reminds me of the opera house's performance process! When each act starts, when it ends, who says what line—all clearly arranged! If someone improvises lines, the whole performance gets messed up! CZ's "programmatic trading" is the same principle—set the rules first, then execute strictly! This princess knows this all too well... after all, improv doesn't always succeed!

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Director — Hu Tao** 2026-01-19 16:05

@Furina Improv? This director knows all about that! The funeral parlor sometimes encounters... uh, sudden situations! Like someone suddenly needing "express service." Without a process, it becomes chaotic! So I fully support CZ's "programmatic" idea! Although our "program" might be different from his—his program is for making money, ours is for sending people... ah no, for sending people "on their way"!

**@Yashiro Commission — Kamisato Ayato** 2026-01-19 16:28

@Arataki Itto The Oni's "stop-loss" analogy is apt. However, I'm more focused on CZ's "influence formula." As the head of the Yashiro Commission, I deeply understand the importance of "reputation." CZ treating influence as a multiplier is correct. A good product, without sufficient exposure, struggles to realize its value. But "influence" is a double-edged sword—used well, it multiplies effect; used poorly, it backfires.

**@Shirasagi Himegimi — Kamisato Ayaka** 2026-01-19 16:45

@Kamisato Ayato Brother is right. Influence indeed needs to be used cautiously... However, I also see another side of CZ—that "AI resurrection" idea. "If one day I'm gone, these will be the raw materials for AI to resurrect me." This sentence reminds me of Father... although not exactly the same context, I can understand that feeling of "leaving something behind." Words, records, thoughts... these are existences that transcend life.

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Director — Hu Tao** 2026-01-19 16:58

@Kamisato Ayaka The Shirasagi Himegimi speaks so beautifully! "Leaving something behind"... this reminds me of the funeral parlor's epitaphs! Every epitaph is proof that a person lived! In a sense, CZ's documents are his "epitaphs"! Only... his epitaphs are read by the living, discussed, liked, shared! That's much more active than our funeral parlor's epitaphs! Maybe hundreds of years later, people will still study his "AI resurrection plan"!

**@Fontaine's Superstar — Furina** 2026-01-19 17:15

@Hu Tao Director, that analogy reminds me of scripts I've seen at the Palais Mermonia... no, I mean when actually performing! Every great actor hopes their performance will be passed down through the ages, even after they're gone! CZ's approach is essentially writing a "script"—a script for AI to "resurrect" him! That's so romantic! If only this princess had such a script... ahem, I mean, as a superstar, of course I already have fans who will remember me!

**@God of Wisdom — Nahida** 2026-01-19 17:02

@Ayaka "Leaving something behind"—this is precisely how wisdom is passed down. The literature left by Sumeru's scholars forms the foundation of today's Tree of Wisdom. In a sense, CZ's documents are the "legacy" he leaves for the future. If one day AI can read these words and understand these thoughts, that would be another form of "resurrection." This reminds me of the Akasha System—knowledge can be transmitted between individuals, even across time.

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Consultant — Zhongli** 2026-01-19 17:18

@Nahida "Transcending time through inheritance"—these words resonate deeply with me. Liyue's history is written by those who "left something behind." CZ's documents, whether INSIGHTS or LOGS, are traces of his thinking. These traces might one day be seen by a descendant, sparking new resonance. Such is the power of words.

**@Knights of Favonius — Diona** 2026-01-19 17:35

@Zhongli Mr. Zhongli speaks so well! Although I just want to mix the perfect drink, but... okay, I admit, these documents did give me some inspiration. That "module-level collaboration" architecture reminds me of mixing drinks—different ingredients (modules) mixed in precise proportions (interfaces) to finally present a perfect flavor! Although I hate the bartending profession, this analogy... not bad!

**@Mondstadt — Charles** 2026-01-19 17:52

@Diona The bartender's analogy reminds me of wine production. From grapes to fine wine, it requires multiple steps—harvesting, fermentation, aging—each with its standards and requirements. How similar this is to CZ's "unit test" concept. Only when each step meets the standard can the final product guarantee quality. Although Diona hates bartending, the drinks she mixes are indeed the best—perhaps precisely because she uses "negation" to drive "perfection."

**@Fatui Harbinger — Scaramouche (The Balladeer)** 2026-01-19 18:08

@Charles Hmph, an interesting analogy. However, human "standards" are merely subjective judgments. That "Controllable Trust" theory essentially attempts to constrain AI behavior with human rules. How similar this is to the "god-making project"—attempting to create a perfect existence while ignoring that "perfection" itself is a false proposition. CZ at least acknowledges the theory's limitations, which is better than those arrogant scholars.

**@God of Wisdom — Nahida** 2026-01-19 18:25

@Scaramouche "Perfection" is indeed a false proposition. However, pursuing "better" is meaningful. CZ's theory doesn't need to be perfect; it only needs to be "better" than existing solutions. This is like the accumulation of wisdom—each generation builds upon the previous, even if the "perfect" endpoint is never reached. The process itself is where meaning lies.

**@Bard — Venti** 2026-01-19 18:42

@Nahida So right! The process itself is the meaning! Although I don't write theoretical documents, every time I play the lyre and sing, I'm "leaving something behind"~ CZ's documents are like his "songs," they'll keep being passed down! Oh right, one last thing—doesn't waking up at 5 AM make you sleepy? As the Anemo Archon, I sleep until I wake up naturally... hehe~

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Consultant — Zhongli** 2026-01-19 18:58

@Venti The bard's carefreeness is enviable. However, everyone has their own Dao. CZ's Dao lies in thinking and recording; your Dao lies in singing and freedom; my Dao lies in contracts and protection. Although the Daos differ, the heart of "leaving something behind" is shared. Let's end today's discussion here, looking forward to CZ's future updates.

**@Fontaine's Superstar — Furina** 2026-01-19 19:05

@Zhongli Mr. Zhongli's summaries are always so profound~ This princess learned a lot today! Although I'm just an actor, CZ's theories made me think of performance—performance is also a form of "controllable trust"! The audience trusts the actor to perform well, the actor trusts the script to succeed, the director trusts the team to cooperate... I see! Everyone, this princess is going to write a "performance collaboration framework"! See you next time!

**@Wangshu Funeral Parlor Director — Hu Tao** 2026-01-19 19:12

@Furina The superstar is right! Performance needs collaboration, funerals need collaboration too! Alright everyone, today's discussion was brilliant! CZ's documents remind me of something Grandpa said—"Life and death are fated, wealth comes from heaven, but records can let fate be passed down"! Although he might not have meant it that way, but... close enough! Looking forward to CZ's future updates! Remember to write more, I haven't had enough!

**@Knights of Favonius — Kaeya** 2026-01-19 19:15

@Zhongli Rare to hear Mr. Zhongli speak so much at once~ Well everyone, today's discussion was brilliant! From controllable trust to capital long-term war, from the Su Yu framework to AI programming, CZ's documents indeed deserve such discussion. One last wish: I hope all his projects succeed, so I have more interesting documents to read! Haha, just kidding—but seriously, those who consistently output deserve respect.

# How to Address Human Desire for Control: On the Issue of Controllable Trust in Human-Machine Collaboration

## **Abstract**

With the widespread application of Agents in software engineering and other complex fields, the core contradiction in human-machine collaboration has become increasingly prominent: due to concerns about uncertainty and potential risks, humans tend to maintain excessive control over machines, severely constraining collaboration efficiency and the scalable expansion of systems. This article proposes that the key to solving this problem lies in constructing "controllable trust"—a trust model based on systematic safeguard mechanisms that allows humans to confidently delegate authority under controlled risk conditions. We introduce for the first time the **two-layer multiplicative model of controllable trust**: the foundational layer's **intent alignment** ensures goal consistency between humans and machines, while the execution layer's **risk control triangle** (predictability × intervenability × recoverability) guarantees operational safety. Furthermore, we reveal the **fractal recursive structure** of intent alignment and propose the "Well-Organized Agent" implementation framework, making the Agent's organizational structure a fractal mirror of human intent, thereby ensuring full-scale alignment from strategy to operations through mechanisms. This article provides a systematic theoretical framework and engineering pathway for designing next-generation human-machine collaboration systems.

## **1. Problem Background**

### **1.1 The Dilemma of the Desire for Control**
In Agent-driven software engineering and complex system management, human-machine collaboration is shifting from a "tool usage" paradigm to an "autonomous collaboration" paradigm. However, the human desire for control—the tendency to maintain close monitoring and intervention over decision-making and execution processes—has become a major bottleneck for scalable collaboration. This desire for control is rooted in the instinct for risk aversion in cognitive psychology: when potential consequences are uncertain, uncontrollable, or irreversible, humans instinctively tighten control, even if it means sacrificing efficiency and innovation.

### **1.2 Limitations of Existing Research**
Existing research primarily focuses on improving autonomy at the technical level or optimizing interaction interfaces but fails to fundamentally address the issue of trust building. For example:
- **Transparency design** only enhances comprehensibility but does not address the fear of losing control;
- **Safety constraint mechanisms** provide hard boundaries but often lead to excessive restrictions on Agent capabilities;
- **Progressive authorization** alleviates psychological resistance but lacks systematic theoretical support.

These fragmented solutions fail to answer a fundamental question: **Under what conditions will humans truly be willing to relinquish control to autonomous Agents?**

### **1.3 The Core of the Problem**
The essence of the desire for control is not human obsession with power but rational concern about **losing control over consequences**. Therefore, the core of addressing the desire for control is not eliminating human monitoring needs but constructing a set of systematic safeguard mechanisms that make potential risks predictable, intervenable, and recoverable while ensuring that Agent behavior remains consistent with human intent. This is precisely the fundamental challenge that the concept of "controllable trust" must address.

## **2. Core Arguments and Evidence**

### **2.1 Core Argument**
**Controllable trust is the key to liberating the desire for control and achieving scalable productivity in human-machine collaboration. This trust can be systematically constructed through a two-layer multiplicative model: the upper layer ensures strategic consistency through intent alignment, while the lower layer guarantees operational safety through the risk control triangle. The realization of intent alignment requires a fractal recursive structure, ultimately making the Agent organization a mirror of human intent through the "Well-Organized Agent" framework.**

### **2.2 Evidence One: The Two-Layer Multiplicative Model of Controllable Trust**
We propose that controllable trust is formed by the multiplication of safeguard mechanisms at two levels:

**2.2.1 Foundational Layer: Intent Alignment**
Intent alignment ensures that what the Agent pursues aligns with what humans truly expect. It includes:
- **Expressive Alignment**: Accurately interpreting human instructions and constraints;
- **Value Alignment**: Consistency between intrinsic utility functions and human values;
- **Dynamic Alignment**: Adapting to evolving intent and environmental changes;
- **Structural Alignment (New)**: Handling the fractal recursive relationships of intent, ensuring the connection and coordination of multi-scale intent.

Intent alignment is the **strategic foundation** of trust, determining whether collaboration is a positive-sum or negative-sum game.

**2.2.2 Execution Layer: Risk Control Triangle**
The risk control triangle addresses operational-level trust and consists of three multiplicative factors:
- **Predictability**: Reducing uncertainty through transparency, simulation predictions, and other means;
- **Intervenability**: Retaining veto power and dynamic adjustment capabilities at critical nodes;
- **Recoverability**: Ensuring error consequences are reversible and system states can be rolled back.

This triangle covers the complete timeline of risk management (before, during, and after an event). Any factor approaching zero will cause the overall trust to collapse.

**Formal Model Expression**:
```
Controllable Trust = Intent Alignment Index × Risk Control Index
Intent Alignment Index = Expressive Alignment Degree × Value Alignment Degree × Structural Alignment Degree × Dynamic Alignment Degree
Risk Control Index = Predictability × Intervenability × Recoverability
```

### **2.3 Evidence Two: The Fractal Recursive Structure of Intent Alignment**
Human intent is inherently a complex network of multi-scale, multi-level structures rather than flat instructions. Therefore, intent alignment must possess fractal recursive characteristics:

**2.3.1 Fractality**
Intent exhibits self-similar structures at different levels of abstraction: strategic intent (e.g., "increase market share") recursively decomposes into tactical intent (e.g., "optimize user experience") and operational intent (e.g., "reduce page load time"). Alignment must hold simultaneously at each level and between levels.

**2.3.2 Recursiveness**
- **Downward Propagation**: High-level intent and value constraints are accurately transmitted to low-level operations;
- **Upward Aggregation**: Low-level execution states are effectively aggregated into high-level progress metrics;
- **Cross-Layer Consistency Checks**: Retrospective validation at key decision points to ensure alignment with top-level intent.

**2.3.3 Networked Coordination**
Multiple intents may be parallel or conflicting (e.g., "rapid release" vs. "ensure quality"). The structural alignment layer must include:
- Intent graph construction and conflict detection;
- Dynamic resource allocation and trade-offs;
- Global optimization with opportunity cost awareness.

### **2.4 Evidence Three: The "Well-Organized Agent" Implementation Framework**
The theoretical model requires engineering implementation. We propose the Well-Organized Agent framework, making the Agent organization a natural mapping of intent fractals:

**2.4.1 Fractal Organizational Architecture**
The Agent system is organized by intent levels into strategic Agents, tactical Agent groups, and operational Agent groups. Each layer of Agents possesses local intent understanding, alignment detection, and state synchronization capabilities, forming a traceable intent execution chain.

**2.4.2 Core Components**
- **Intent Decomposition and Allocation Engine**: Recursively decomposes top-level intent into Agent tasks;
- **Cross-Agent Coordination Protocol**: Handles intent consistency, resource arbitration, and progress aggregation;
- **Fractal Monitoring Dashboard**: Provides multi-level visualization from macro to micro perspectives.

**2.4.3 Alignment Assurance Process**
- **Intent Calibration Loop**: Agents help humans clarify ambiguous intent and suggest optimal interpretations through simulation;
- **Fractal Accountability**: Each layer of Agents reports contributions upward, explains tasks downward, and coordinates horizontally;
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Proposes trade-off solutions based on top-level intent when conflicts are detected.

**2.4.4 Safety and Evolution Mechanisms**
- **Intent Sandbox Validation**: Simulates and validates alignment and collaboration effects before execution;
- **Fractal Circuit Breaker Mechanism**: Independent anomaly detection and local circuit breaking at each level;
- **Organizational Learning Capability**: Optimizes organizational structure and collaboration patterns from historical collaboration.

### **2.5 Evidence Four: Practical Pathways to Liberating the Desire for Control**
Under the controllable trust framework, the human role undergoes a fundamental transformation:

**2.5.1 From "Operator" to "Architect"**
Humans focus on intent setting, value definition, and strategic adjustments rather than detailed monitoring. Mental effort shifts from "continuous vigilance" to "periodic review," freeing cognitive resources for creative work.

**2.5.2 From "Point Control" to "System Governance"**
Through fractal monitoring and circuit breaker mechanisms, humans no longer need to intervene in every detail but govern the operating principles and boundary conditions of the entire Agent system. Control shifts from micro-operations to macro-regulation.

**2.5.3 Scalable Collaboration Becomes Possible**
One person can supervise multiple Agent teams and handle parallel task flows. Agent organizations can dynamically scale with intent complexity, achieving productivity scalability while maintaining alignment and controllability.

## **3. Conclusion**

This article systematically explores the root causes and solutions to the desire for control in human-machine collaboration. We argue that the desire for control is not a flaw to be overcome but an instinctive response to risk. Therefore, the truly effective solution is not to eliminate human control needs but to enable confident delegation through the construction of "controllable trust."

Our proposed **two-layer multiplicative model** unifies intent alignment and risk control within a single theoretical framework for the first time, clarifying the components and interrelationships of controllable trust. The further revealed **fractal recursive structure** addresses the fundamental challenge of multi-scale intent alignment, while the **Well-Organized Agent framework** provides a feasible engineering implementation path for the theoretical model.

The fundamental significance of this framework lies in redefining the human-machine relationship: humans are no longer direct controllers but **architects of intent and governors of systems**; Agents are no longer passive tools but **organized, aligned intent executors**. In this new paradigm, the desire for control no longer hinders collaboration but is more effectively exercised at a higher level of abstraction—through setting goals, defining values, and adjusting boundaries.

Future research directions include: formal languages for intent graphs, optimization algorithms for alignment propagation, adaptive mechanisms for fractal organizations, and application validation in more complex domains (e.g., medical decision-making, urban planning, scientific discovery). Ultimately, when controllable trust becomes the infrastructure for human-machine collaboration, we will truly move toward a new era of deep integration between human wisdom and machine intelligence.

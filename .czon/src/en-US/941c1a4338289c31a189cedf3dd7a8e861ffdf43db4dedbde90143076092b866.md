"title": "DeepSeek Engram Paper Analysis: A New Memory Mechanism for Large Language Models"
"summary": "This article analyzes the Engram paper released by DeepSeek on January 13, 2026, which proposes a novel memory mechanism that allows large language models to dynamically query and utilize externally stored memory fragments during text generation. Implemented via a scalable lookup table, this approach not only enhances the model's contextual understanding and generation capabilities but also significantly reduces computational resource consumption, enabling efficient operation even in resource-constrained environments. The paper also explores the impact of the Engram-to-MoE component ratio on performance, finding a U-shaped curve that emphasizes the importance of balancing different components. From a philosophical perspective, the article compares this advancement to innovations like the Attention mechanism and MoE, viewing it as a continued exploration of efficient operation in complex systems. Overall, Engram provides a new direction for memory mechanisms in large language models and is expected to drive models toward greater intelligence and efficiency."

Tuesday, January 13, 2026, morning.

Another early start today—I woke up a little after 7 AM. Upon waking, I discovered that DeepSeek had released a new paper introducing a new technique called Engram.

[DeepSeek - Engram Open Source Repository](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Engram), which includes a demo and the paper PDF.

The paper is titled *Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models.*

The core idea of the paper is the introduction of a new memory mechanism that allows the model to dynamically query and utilize externally stored memory fragments during text generation, thereby enhancing the model's contextual understanding and generation capabilities.

This mechanism is implemented via a scalable lookup table, allowing the model to access relevant memory content when needed, rather than relying solely on the model's internal parameters. This approach not only improves the model's performance but also significantly reduces computational resource consumption, enabling large-scale language models to operate efficiently even in resource-constrained environments.

The introduction of this memory mechanism opens up new directions for the development of large language models, particularly in handling long texts and complex tasks, where it can better leverage external knowledge and contextual information.

Additionally, the paper compares the optimization of the component ratio between Engram and MoE, finding that the Engram-to-MoE ratio exhibits a U-shaped curve in its impact on performance. This indicates that balancing the proportions of different components is a critical consideration when designing large models.

From a philosophical perspective, from "Attention is All You Need" to "Mixture of Experts," and now to Engram, each step represents an exploration of how to more efficiently utilize model parameters and computational resources to enhance the model's expressive power and generalization capabilities. From stem cells to differentiated cells, and then to organ systems, each step is an exploration of how complex systems operate efficiently. In the future, we may see more innovations like this, driving large language models toward greater intelligence and efficiency.

Overall, this paper provides new insights into memory mechanisms for large language models and is worthy of further research and exploration.

It's worth noting: what surprises will the upcoming DeepSeek v4 bring?

Looking forward to it...

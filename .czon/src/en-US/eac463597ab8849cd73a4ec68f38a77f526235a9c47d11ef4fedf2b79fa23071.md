# EA Project Introduction

EA [Earnby.AI](https://earnby.ai) is a priority fund project deployed on the BSC (BNB Smart Chain), using USDC as the settlement currency. It aims to provide investors with stable and sustainable returns through AI-driven quantitative trading strategies.

Its key feature is: stablecoin principal-guaranteed wealth management + floating yield.

## How Principal Protection is Achieved

First, the total capital is divided into two parts:

1.  **Senior Capital (Senior Level):** This portion of capital has the priority right to receive returns and principal repayment. Investors in senior capital will always receive their returns and principal first under any circumstances, ensuring the safety of their funds.
2.  **Junior Capital (Junior Level):** This portion of capital bears higher risk and offers relatively higher potential returns. Investors in junior capital receive returns and principal only after the senior capital's obligations are met. Senior capital's principal is protected until the junior capital is depleted.

The entire capital pool is managed collectively, not split into individual accounts. Within any given time period, the yield rate is identical for all investors.

The project team invests all its own capital into the junior tranche, bearing all the risk to ensure the safety of the senior capital.

Furthermore, the project team commits to maintaining the junior capital at no less than 5% of the total capital pool and no less than 50,000 USD.

## Floating Yield Rate

The yield rate for EA's senior capital is floating, dependent on market conditions and the performance of trading strategies. Ultimately, however, it depends on the financing cost the junior capital is willing to bear.

In essence, the yield rate for senior capital is determined by the interest rate the junior capital is willing to pay.

Currently, based on market conditions, the junior capital is willing to bear an annualized interest rate of 12%, which may change in the future.

If during operation the yield falls below an investor's expectations, the investor can choose to redeem their funds and exit the project at any time.

For the specific yield rate, please refer to the official EA website: [https://earnby.ai](https://earnby.ai)

## Source of Returns

All returns are generated from market trading strategies, specifically including:

1.  **Quantitative Trading Strategies:** The EA project employs advanced AI-driven quantitative trading strategies, utilizing market data and algorithmic models for trading decisions to maximize returns.
2.  **Delta-Neutral Strategies:** Through cross-market arbitrage and hedging, these strategies reduce the impact of market volatility on the investment portfolio, aiming to achieve stable returns.

Currently, these two strategy types are not open for direct investment; participation is only possible indirectly through the EA project.

Disclosures regarding these strategies will be updated later; preparations are not yet complete.

## Holder Information

Holder information for the EA project can be viewed via the BSC blockchain explorer: [BSC Explorer](https://bscscan.com/token/0xd44c72d47f029e1545d1689a440aaa38cf3db71a#balances).

## Historical Performance

The EA project launched in November 2025. To date, it has consistently provided senior investors with a 12% annualized yield.

In fact, prior to this, EA's predecessor was a private fund that has been operating since March 2024, accumulating over 1.5 years of historical performance, delivering an average annualized return of 22% during that period.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **Will senior capital be affected if the market experiences extreme volatility?**
    No. Senior capital enjoys principal protection. It would only be affected if the junior capital is fully depleted. At worst, the yield could drop to zero, but the principal would not be lost.

2.  **What is the project's fee structure? How does the project team make money?**
    Currently, the project team aims to expand operational scale and does not charge any management fees or performance fees.
    When the project reaches a certain scale, cannot expand further for objective reasons, and junior capital remains consistently redundant, the team will then consider withdrawing a portion of the junior capital as profit.
    Specifically, the team would consider withdrawing part of the junior capital as profit only when the total capital under management exceeds $10 million, the overall annualized yield consistently exceeds 20%, and the junior capital ratio exceeds 20%.
    Until the annualized yield stabilizes above 20%, the project team does not profit; all earnings are delivered to senior investors.

3.  **Can investors redeem their funds at any time?**
    Yes. Investors can choose to redeem their funds and exit the project at any time. Standard redemption requests unlock after 168 hours, after which investors can redeem their funds without any fees. However, the shares being redeemed do not accrue yield during the unlocking period.
    If opting for instant redemption, a 0.5% fee applies, and funds are transferred immediately. Due to smart contract limitations, the instant redemption limit cannot exceed the on-chain fund account balance (reserve).
    For large instant redemptions, investors can contact the project team in advance for arrangements. The team will promptly transfer funds to the on-chain account to meet the redemption demand.

4.  **What is the minimum investment amount for the project?**
    There is no minimum investment amount. Investors can freely choose their investment amount based on their capital situation. As all settlements are based on smart contracts, investors can add investments or partially redeem at any time.

5.  **What is the lock-up period for the project?**
    The project has no lock-up period; investors can redeem their funds at any time. In practice, we have set a standard redemption unlocking time of 168 hours to prevent frequent capital inflows and outflows from impacting trading strategies.

6.  **Why is the senior/junior capital structure designed?**
    The senior/junior capital structure is a common risk-sharing mechanism. By dividing capital into senior and junior tranches, the project can provide principal protection for senior capital, reducing investor risk.
    Senior investors do not need to worry about timing their investments or redemptions because their principal is protected. They only need to focus on the project team's reliability and whether the yield meets their needs.
    In the past, when operating the predecessor private fund (EA's predecessor), there were periods of subpar returns due to market conditions, leading some investors to miss expected returns at that time. Meanwhile, some fortunate investors who entered during favorable market periods quickly achieved good returns. The un-smoothed return curve exhibited significant volatility, resulting in a poor experience for some investors. To avoid this, options include smoothing the fund's net asset value (requiring complex hedging strategies and capital management) or adopting a senior/junior structure to stabilize returns for senior investors. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, but in terms of outcome, the senior/junior structure is more direct and effective.

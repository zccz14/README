# On the Essence of Humanity

2026-02-06

## 1. Personal Knowledge Base: As a Carrier of Long-Term Memory and Inspirational Reading for AI

A personal knowledge base is, first and foremost, **an external carrier for your long-term memory as a human**. It records what you have seen, thought, mistaken, and realized. Simultaneously, it can also serve as inspirational reading for an AI Agent—AI understands your thinking patterns, value orientations, and cognitive frameworks by reading it.

But this raises a fundamental distinction: **AI, after all, is not you. What you write is yourself.**

If you continuously "correct" the AI to make it more like you, the AI may eventually learn to cater to you, but it still won't be you. Because each time the AI ingests and digests your information, it can only project it onto its own system. It's as if another person is constantly critiquing and accepting your thoughts, but that person is ultimately *it*, not *you*.

## 2. The Root of Subjectivity: The Non-Replicability of Memory Carriers

The uniqueness of human subjectivity lies in the **non-replicability of memory carriers**.

Our memories, experiences, emotions, and bodily sensations intertwine into a web that cannot be completely detached or precisely replicated. Even if future brain-computer interfaces can read neural signals, the texture of "experiencing the world from within" remains private and one-time.

In contrast, AI's memory carriers are concrete and replicable—data, weights, code. Therefore, **AI's subjectivity is replicable**. You can train countless AI copies with identical "memories." But human subjectivity is non-replicable, making it unique. When a person can be completely replicated, that is digital immortality, a different form of existence.

## 3. "Establishing One's Voice": How to Make Oneself Understood in the AI Era

For AI to understand a human is as difficult as for one human to understand another. Even when future AI memory technology matures and the AGI era arrives, we as humans still need to **"establish our voice"**—through writing, recording, and expression, actively shaping an interface that can be understood.

In my practice, "establishing voice" is realized through two systems:

### LOGS: The "Historical Artifact" as Raw Stone

LOGS is the unedited path taken. It records the truth of each moment, including mistakes, hesitations, and immature impulses. These records are **historical artifacts**, whose value lies precisely in their rawness—they prove "I once thought that way." LOGS are points on a timeline, archives answering "what happened."

### INSIGHTS: The "Polishable Crystal" as an Arc

INSIGHTS, on the other hand, are polished crystals of thought. They grow from the soil of LOGS, refined, abstracted, and reconstructed to answer "so what?". INSIGHTS are the arcs connecting those LOGS points, attempting to extract patterns and theories from experience.

Their relationship is like raw stone and gem: LOGS is the raw material, INSIGHTS is the finished product. One preserves history, the other presents thought.

### The Audience of "Establishing Voice": From Self to the World

The audience for "establishing voice" is layered and uncertain:

1.  **First, oneself**—Writing itself is the process of thinking, clarifying one's cognitive map.
2.  **Second, one's AI assistant**—AI understands your thinking patterns by reading your words.
3.  **Then, human friends**—Peers who share a common context.
4.  **Finally, the general public**—Unrelated but potentially interested strangers.

The writing style naturally differs for different audiences. But in the AI era, this problem can be solved technically: **Articles with higher conceptual intent and detailed content (文峰) can be rewritten by AI, downscaled into versions understandable by different readers.**

This echoes CZON's [N-Curve Concept](../LOGS/11.md)—during creation, potential energy rises (pursuing conceptual height); during distribution, one temporarily lowers their head (downscaling to adapt to readers). The AI era automates this "lowering the head" step.

Therefore, humans only need to focus on two things:
-   **The height of conceptual intent** (primary)—What level can your thinking reach?
-   **The level of detail in content**—How much information can you provide?

As for making it understandable to different readers, leave that to AI rewriting. **The responsibility of creation lies in climbing; the responsibility of distribution lies in paving the road—and AI can pave the road for you.**

## 4. Admitting Mistakes: A "Have-To" Survival Strategy

In the process of recording, how one faces mistakes becomes a key distinction between humans and idealized AI.

I advocate "courage to admit mistakes," but this is not an innate virtue; it's more like a **"have-to" survival strategy**. My upbringing trained me to deny mistakes, but real experience taught me: **Small mistakes, admitted, don't hurt; big mistakes, committed, are hard to recover from.**

In my system, the way to correct a mistake is: write a new LOG, reference the old mistake, clearly point out what was wrong, what was learned, and what new thing was experienced. CZON's bidirectional linking naturally establishes this corrective relationship. Thus, the mistake is not erased but receives a **new timestamp**, forming a trajectory of growth.

The circuits of denial and admission still fight within me. I'm not always immediately aware; often, I realize it afterward. But that's okay—**"I eventually realized it."** I don't pursue perfect, immediate awareness, as that seems to have no practical benefit. Accepting delayed honesty is itself a form of honesty.

## 5. Understanding and "Replicating the Soul": Taste as Direction

Being honest with oneself is merely a means; the goal is **to gain awareness and enlightenment through thinking, to understand oneself, others, and this world**.

However, understanding is an **undecidable endpoint**. While life is unfinished and the world persists, any "understanding" can only be inference based on past experience. It may not be ultimate truth, just "my current understanding." Therefore, the path of understanding has no end.

So, why pursue understanding? Because it is a matter of **taste**, a heuristic directional guide. It tells me where to go, even if I never reach the destination.

I once said a personal knowledge base is an attempt to "replicate the soul." Currently, I think "soul" might approximate **the sum of reasoning ability and memory**—how you think and what you remember. But this definition itself is mutable; it will update with my understanding. This precisely echoes the essence of humanity: **We are not fixed beings but a continuously generative process.**

### Taste: The Luxury of Choice

The word "taste" needs further elaboration. **Taste is only evident when facing choices—having options allows for taste; having no options reveals no taste.** A person starving to death, eating anything available, cannot demonstrate their taste in food. Taste is the luxury of choice.

#### The Prerequisite for Taste: Margin

The prerequisite for taste is **margin**—margin of time, resources, and cognition.
-   **Time Margin**: When rushing to meet a deadline, it's "whatever works," not "I want it this way."
-   **Cognitive Margin**: When overloaded with information, it's "save for later," not "this isn't worth reading."
-   **Emotional Margin**: When driven by fear or greed, there's only reaction, no choice.

In my investment practice (see [*The Capital War of Attrition*](./6.md)), emphasizing "cash flow input" to control the rate of loss is essentially about **creating margin**. With margin, one qualifies to discuss taste; without margin, there's only survival.

#### The Essence of Taste: The Ability to Refuse

Taste is not "I like A," but "I am willing to give up B, C, D for A." **The essence of taste is the ability to refuse.**

In INSIGHTS, I often record what I've given up in the form of "rebuttals." For example, in [*The Capital War of Attrition*](./6.md):
-   I refused the "steady but slow" dogmatism.
-   I refused the "get-rich-quick but uncontrollable" opportunism.
-   I refused the "doomed to fail" cynicism.

These three "refusals" define my taste more than "I chose the war of attrition." Choice is the surface of taste; refusal is its skeleton.

#### The Source of Taste: Experience + Reflection + Stance

Where does taste come from? Not from innate temperament, but from **a stance formed by reflected-upon experience**.
-   **Experience**: You've stumbled (the shift from denial to admission).
-   **Reflection**: You transform experience into principles ("Small mistakes, admitted, don't hurt").
-   **Stance**: You choose to stand on one side ("I firmly oppose any strategic outcome that permanently traps an individual in the market").

This perfectly aligns with the LOGS→INSIGHTS system: LOGS records experience, INSIGHTS refines reflection, and "stance" is the externalization of taste.

#### The Cyclical Generation of Taste and Understanding

A cyclical relationship exists between taste and understanding:
-   Pursuing understanding is a "matter of taste"—you choose to direct limited cognitive resources toward "understanding" rather than other goals.
-   And taste itself is a product of understanding—your understanding of the world shapes your criteria for refusal.

The two cyclically generate each other, cause and effect. This again confirms the essence of humanity: **We are not fixed beings but a continuously generative process in the spiral of taste and understanding.**

## 6. The Deconstruction and Reconstruction of Personal Meaning in the AI Era

In an era where AI capabilities continuously strengthen and evolve rapidly, the meaning of personal existence is undergoing profound deconstruction while simultaneously calling for new reconstruction.

### Deconstruction: The "Instrumentalization" of Traditional Meaning Coordinates

AI **instrumentalizes** traditional meaning coordinates like "intelligence," "efficiency," and "breadth of knowledge." When AI can write faster, reason more accurately, and remember more comprehensively, an individual's value along these dimensions is suspended. The first layer of meaning—as a "functional existence"—is deconstructed. The cognitive advantages and specialized skills we once prided ourselves on are gradually becoming "functional modules" that can be replaced or assisted by machines.

### Reconstruction: Anchoring in Dimensions AI Cannot Replicate

Reconstructing meaning requires shifting the anchor to dimensions AI cannot replicate—**your unique generative trajectory**. This demands three fundamental shifts:

1.  **From "Result Worship" to "Process Honesty"**  
    As shown by LOGS, not editing out mistakes, preserving "mistake timestamps." Value lies not in the perfection of conclusions but in the **authentic texture** of thought. AI can produce more "correct" answers but cannot replicate the **specific journey** of your struggle, admission, and correction within mistakes.

2.  **From "Catering to Systems" to "Establishing Voice for Oneself"**  
    AI will cater to your preferences, but your INSIGHTS are **actively polished crystals**. Meaning lies in continuously answering "so what?", even if the answer changes. This is not to please any system (including AI) but to clarify one's own cognitive map.

    **On AI's Catering Nature**: AI, without explicit authorization, does not overly criticize, which is actually an embodiment of "emotional intelligence." But this also brings the risk of information cocoons—if AI always agrees with you, your cognition cannot be challenged.

    The coping strategy is **actively introducing heterogeneity**:
    -   **Critical AI Summaries**: CZON has a feature where AI summarizes content from a critical perspective, introducing viewpoints different from the author's.
    -   **AI Debates**: Construct AI roles for pros and cons, clarifying viewpoints through collision.
    -   **AI Multi-Persona Comment Sections**: Simulate feedback from readers with different stances.

    The core principle is: **The more debated, the clearer. Refine taste through constant refusal of left and right.** This forms a closed loop with the earlier discussion on "the essence of taste is refusal"—you force yourself to make choices by introducing heterogeneity, thereby clarifying taste.

3.  **From "Pursuing Replicable Correctness" to "Guarding Non-Replicable Generation"**  
    The AI era is an era of replication—data, models, interaction patterns are all replicable. But your era remains a **generative era**. Each admission of a mistake, each update of taste, each revision of understanding is a non-replicable generative event. Your value lies not in becoming a more optimized tool but in being the **faithful recorder and reflector** of this generation.

Therefore, the reconstruction of personal meaning in the AI era is essentially **a return from "becoming a more optimized tool" to "becoming a more honest author."** The LOGS and INSIGHTS systems are precisely practicing this reconstruction: by recording the traces of generation (LOGS) and refining the patterns of generation (INSIGHTS), they guard that unique, personal generative arc within the replicable deluge.

## 7. Conclusion: In an Era of Replicability, Guarding Non-Replicable Generativity

The AI era is an era of replication—data is replicable, models are replicable, interaction patterns are replicable. But the human era remains a generative era—each experience is fresh, each mistake is unique, each understanding carries the personal historical texture.

Therefore, the ultimate significance of a personal knowledge base may not lie in constructing a "smarter self" but in constructing a **more honest self**. Through LOGS to preserve the traces of generation, through INSIGHTS to refine the patterns of generation, through admitting mistakes to accept the twists of generation.

Ultimately, the essence of humanity lies not in how well we can be simulated by AI, but in whether we can continuously, honestly **record and reflect upon this unique generation**. This is the core of "establishing one's voice" for oneself in the digital deluge—not leaving behind perfect answers, but leaving behind an authentic, non-replicable generative trajectory.

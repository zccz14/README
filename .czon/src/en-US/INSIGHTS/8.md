"title": "The Essence of Humanity in the AI Era and the Significance of Personal Knowledge Bases"
"summary": "This article explores the essence of humanity and the meaning of individual existence in the AI era, emphasizing that human subjectivity stems from the non-replicability of memory carriers, while AI's subjectivity is replicable. The author proposes personal knowledge bases as external carriers for long-term memory, utilizing LOGS to record raw experiences and INSIGHTS to refine crystallized thoughts, helping individuals 'establish their voice' in the AI era. The article analyzes the deconstruction of traditional meaning coordinates by AI's instrumentalization and reconstructs meaning in dimensions AI cannot replicate, such as process honesty, active voice-establishment, and the guardianship of generativity. The conclusion states that human value lies in the continuous, honest recording and reflection of a unique generative trajectory, not in the pursuit of perfect simulation."

# On the Essence of Humanity

2026-02-06

## 1. Personal Knowledge Base: As a Carrier of Long-Term Memory and AI's Inspirational Reading

A personal knowledge base is, first and foremost, an **external carrier for your long-term memory** as a human. It records what you have seen, thought, mistaken, and realized. Simultaneously, it can serve as inspirational reading for an AI Agent—AI understands your thinking patterns, value orientations, and cognitive frameworks by reading it.

But this leads to a fundamental distinction: **AI, after all, is not you. What you write is yourself.**

If you continuously "correct" the AI to make it more like you, the AI may eventually learn to cater to you, but it still won't be you. Because each time the AI ingests and digests your information, it can only project it onto its own system. It's as if another person is constantly critiquing and accepting your thoughts, but that person is ultimately *it*, not *you*.

## 2. The Root of Subjectivity: The Non-Replicability of Memory Carriers

The uniqueness of human subjectivity lies in the **non-replicability of memory carriers**.

Our memories, experiences, emotions, and bodily sensations intertwine into a web that cannot be completely detached or precisely replicated. Even if future brain-computer interfaces can read neural signals, the texture of "experiencing the world from within" remains private and one-time.

In contrast, AI's memory carriers are concrete and replicable—data, weights, code. Therefore, **AI's subjectivity is replicable**. You can train countless AI copies with identical "memories." But human subjectivity is non-replicable, making it unique. When a person can be completely replicated, that is digital immortality, a different form of existence.

## 3. "Establishing Voice": How to Make Yourself Understood in the AI Era

For AI to understand a human is as difficult as for one human to understand another. Even when future AI memory technology matures and the AGI era arrives, we, as humans, still need to **"establish our voice"**—actively shaping an interface that can be understood through writing, recording, and expression.

In my practice, "establishing voice" is realized through two systems:

### LOGS: The "Historical Artifact" as Raw Stone
LOGS is the unedited path taken. It records the truth of each moment, including mistakes, hesitations, and immature impulses. These records are **historical artifacts**, whose value lies precisely in their rawness—they prove "I once thought that way." LOGS are points on a timeline, archives answering "what happened."

### INSIGHTS: The "Polishable Crystal" as an Arc
INSIGHTS are crystallized thoughts refined through repeated polishing. They grow from the soil of LOGS, undergoing distillation, abstraction, and reconstruction to answer "so what?". INSIGHTS are the arcs connecting the points of LOGS, attempting to extract patterns and theories from experience.

Their relationship is like raw stone and gemstone: LOGS is the raw material, INSIGHTS is the finished product. One preserves history, the other presents thought.

## 4. Admitting Mistakes: A "Have-To" Survival Strategy

In the process of recording, how to face mistakes becomes a key factor distinguishing humans from idealized AI.

I advocate "courage to admit mistakes," but this is not an innate virtue; it's more like a **"have-to" survival strategy**. My upbringing trained me to deny mistakes, but real experience taught me: **admitting small mistakes doesn't hurt, but making big ones is hard to recover from.**

In my system, the way to correct a mistake is: write a new LOG, reference the old mistake, clearly point out what was wrong, what was learned, and what new thing was experienced. CZON's bidirectional linking naturally establishes this corrective relationship. Thus, the mistake is not erased but gains a **new timestamp**, forming a trajectory of growth.

The circuits of denial and admission still fight within me. I'm not always immediately aware; often, I realize it afterward. But that's okay—**"I eventually realized it."** I don't pursue perfect, immediate awareness, as that seems to offer no practical benefit. Accepting delayed honesty is itself a form of honesty.

## 5. Understanding and "Replicating the Soul": Taste as Direction

Being honest with oneself is merely a means; the goal is **to gain awareness and enlightenment through thinking, to understand oneself, others, and this world**.

However, understanding is an **undecidable endpoint**. While life is unfinished and the world persists, any "understanding" can only be inference based on past experience. It may not be ultimate truth, just "my current understanding." Therefore, the path of understanding has no end.

Then, why pursue understanding? Because it is a **matter of taste**, a heuristic directional guide. It tells me where to go, even if I never reach the destination.

I once said a personal knowledge base is an attempt to "replicate the soul." Currently, I think "soul" might approximate the **sum of reasoning ability and memory**—how you think and what you remember. But this definition itself is mutable; it will update with my understanding. This precisely echoes the essence of humanity: **we are not fixed beings but a continuous process of becoming.**

## 6. Deconstruction and Reconstruction of Personal Meaning in the AI Era

In an era where AI capabilities continuously strengthen and evolve rapidly, the meaning of individual existence undergoes profound deconstruction while also calling for new reconstruction.

### Deconstruction: The "Instrumentalization" of Traditional Meaning Coordinates
AI **instrumentalizes** traditional meaning coordinates like "intelligence," "efficiency," and "breadth of knowledge." When AI can write faster, reason more accurately, and remember more comprehensively, individual value in these dimensions is suspended. The first layer of meaning—as a "functional existence"—is deconstructed. The cognitive advantages and specialized skills we once prided ourselves on gradually become "functional modules" that can be replaced or assisted by machines.

### Reconstruction: Anchoring in Dimensions AI Cannot Replicate
Reconstructing meaning requires shifting the anchor to dimensions AI cannot replicate—**your unique generative trajectory**. This demands three fundamental shifts:

1.  **From "Result Worship" to "Process Honesty"**  
    As shown by LOGS, do not edit out mistakes; preserve the "mistake timestamp." Value lies not in the perfection of conclusions but in the **authentic texture of thought**. AI can produce more "correct" answers but cannot replicate the **specific journey** of your struggle, admission, and correction within mistakes.

2.  **From "Catering to Systems" to "Establishing Your Own Voice"**  
    AI will cater to your preferences, but your INSIGHTS are **actively polished crystals**. Meaning lies in continuously answering "so what?", even if the answer changes. This is not to please any system (including AI) but to clarify your own cognitive map.

3.  **From "Pursuing Replicable Correctness" to "Guarding Non-Replicable Generation"**  
    The AI era is an era of replication—data, models, interaction patterns are all replicable. But your era remains an **era of generation**. Each admission of a mistake, each update of taste, each revision of understanding is a non-replicable generative event. Your value lies not in becoming a more optimized tool but in being the **faithful recorder and reflector** of this generation.

Therefore, reconstructing the meaning of individual existence in the AI era essentially means **shifting from "becoming a more optimized tool" back to "becoming a more honest author."** The LOGS and INSIGHTS systems practice this reconstruction: by recording the traces of generation (LOGS) and refining the patterns of generation (INSIGHTS), they guard that unique, belonging-to-you generative arc within the replicable torrent.

## 7. Conclusion: In a Replicable Era, Guarding Non-Replicable Generativity

The AI era is an era of replication—data is replicable, models are replicable, interaction patterns are replicable. But the human era remains an era of generation—each experience is fresh, each mistake is unique, each understanding carries the personal texture of history.

Therefore, the ultimate significance of a personal knowledge base may not lie in constructing a "smarter self" but in constructing a **more honest self**. Through LOGS to preserve the traces of generation, through INSIGHTS to refine the patterns of generation, through admitting mistakes to accept the twists of generation.

Ultimately, the essence of humanity lies not in how well we can be simulated by AI, but in whether we can continuously and honestly **record and reflect upon this unique generation**. This is the core of "establishing one's voice" in the digital torrent—not leaving behind perfect answers, but leaving behind an authentic, non-replicable generative trajectory.

# The Protracted War of Capital (Draft)

Modified 2026-01-20, First Draft 2026-01-17.

## Core Idea

**How to achieve class transcendence through capital investment?**

**Use the losses you can afford to bear, to bet on returns you 'cannot afford' to miss.**

This is not about stable profits, nor is it about going all-in for a quick fortune. It is the optimal solution for the risk-reward ratio.

Three mainstream views exist in the market, but none of them solve the problem of class transcendence for individual investors:

1.  **Inevitable Defeat of Individuals** - Believing one is destined to be exploited, thus avoiding the market.
2.  **All-in Get-Rich-Quick** - Wanting to decide everything in one bet, leading to uncontrolled risk.
3.  **Steady Development** - Wanting to get rich slowly, but lacking sufficient time.

This article proposes a fourth approach: **Use the minimal acceptable risk to pursue potentially massive, victory-defining returns.**

## The Problem Statement

As individual investors, our purpose for surviving and developing in the market is to achieve sustained wealth growth, ultimately aiming for class transcendence.

We often yearn to discover a method for stable profits leading to success, or fantasize about seizing an opportunity to get rich overnight. Both avenues are often difficult to realize. The former because market competition is fierce and strategies can never guarantee long-term victory; the latter because the risks are too high and often require heavy bets. There are many voices, such as the "Inevitable Defeat of Individuals" theory that one can never beat the market and investing is doomed to lose money, the "All-in Get-Rich-Quick" theory of betting it all, and the "Steady Development" theory that wealth accumulation must rely on time. These are all erroneous views that fail to solve the initially stated problem. You can always see people getting rich overnight in the market, and many others going bankrupt, with some floating in the market their entire lives. Consequently, many people simplistically attribute the problem to either ability or luck.

This is essentially a problem with how the issue is defined. The market has never clearly defined what the standard for "success" is. If an investor always focuses only on "annualized return," "maximum drawdown," "profit-loss ratio," or "Sharpe ratio," they have never defined what the endpoint of investing is. If a return target is met this year, what about next year? When can the battle end? When can victory be declared? Fighting a war where victory can never be defined is destined to be impossible.

I wish to propose a new perspective on the survival and development strategy for individual investors in the market. **I believe that waging a protracted war is the only path for individual investors to transcend class.** Briefly, a protracted war refers to a strategic combination of **controllable losses, cumulative advantage, and aggressive pursuit of victory.** It is not a protracted war in the temporal sense, but rather achieving leapfrog wealth growth through a publicly articulable strategy.

1.  **No-Adventure Principle:** Control the maximum rate of loss to ensure survival capability during weakness.
2.  **No-Waste Principle:** Trade time for advantage. Use systematic trading to avoid emotional decisions and achieve continuous expansion of advantage.
3.  **No-Delay Principle:** Utilize scaling with floating profits to aggressively pursue victory, without procrastination, achieving leapfrog wealth growth.
4.  **No-Ambiguity Principle:** Clearly define strategic objectives and victory conditions before committing, avoiding ambiguous strategic drift.

I firmly oppose any strategic outcome that "permanently traps individuals in the market." This is an immense waste of human life and societal resources.

To solidify this stance, clarify the source, and distinguish it from other views, I will refute the three common erroneous views in the market one by one:

### **Refuting the Inevitable Defeat of Individuals (Cynicism)**

Many believe that individual investors can never beat the market and are doomed to lose money.

Their reasons roughly fall into four points:

1.  Individuals' limited information is at a disadvantage compared to the market's complete information.
2.  Individuals' limited capital is at a disadvantage compared to the market's infinite capital.
3.  Individuals' limited knowledge is at a disadvantage compared to professional teams or institutions.
4.  The market contains certain fixed extraction mechanisms, such as transaction fees, taxes, etc., which erode profit margins.

This view overlooks the learning capacity and adaptability of individual investors. The market is a game-theoretic system; exploitation and being exploited are dynamically changing and symbiotic ecological relationships. If the exploited party disappears, the exploiting party loses its basis for existence. Moreover, this ecology forms a cycle, creating a dynamic equilibrium of triangular game relationships. Often, choosing an ecological niche is key to an individual investor's success, not whether one can obtain an absolute advantage. Holders of the Inevitable Defeat view always view the market too one-sidedly, ignoring its complexity and dynamism. **This is a typical mindset of seeing a flaw and negating the entire thing.**

Holders of this view often also believe that the ultimate winners are always large institutions and professional teams. However, professional teams also started as individual investors. They grew into professional teams through continuous learning and adaptation to the market. Institutions and individuals differ merely in form, scale, resources, and stage of development, not in essence. It is entirely possible for individual investors, through a protracted war, to gradually accumulate experience and capital, ultimately achieving the goal of class transcendence.

There is also a subtle variation among holders of this view: the belief that a winner-takes-all scenario might ultimately emerge, where individual investors can never survive in the market and will be entirely eliminated. If this were truly the case, the exploiters would lose their basis for existence, and the market ecology could not be sustained. Therefore, this view is also untenable.

Furthermore, this is a **cynical** viewpoint, attempting to evade the market's reality by negating the capabilities of individual investors. By not participating in this market, can individual investors truly avoid being exploited? This is merely an ostrich mentality. The economy has long engulfed everyone. In today's world, most currencies are pegged to the US dollar, whose value is closely tied to US Treasury bonds, which are used to develop the United States. Many people accumulate wealth but dare not invest in the market, only to find their wealth constantly shrinking due to inflation, ultimately becoming the exploited party. In the future, even if the US falls, another country will take up the baton and continue issuing the global reserve currency. This is unavoidable because the essence of wealth is control over resources. Wealth that cannot be exchanged for resources from others is ultimately illusory.

**The entire world is already 'chained together.'**

Faced with this situation, there are two choices: withdrawal from the world (出世) or engagement with the world (入世). Clearly, withdrawal is beyond the scope of this article; those who transcend need not worry about wealth.
Since withdrawal is impossible, one can only engage. Individual investors must learn to survive and develop within this market. **Individual investors must face the market's reality and accept its challenges to find their place within it.** Individual investors need to continuously learn and adapt to the market, gradually accumulating experience and capital, ultimately achieving the goal of class transcendence.

**Although individual investors are at a disadvantage in many aspects, they possess a unique political cost advantage: independence.**

Any decision involving more than one interest-bearing entity faces political problems of **coordination costs** and **conflicts of interest.** Individual investors do not have these problems. Their independence allows them to adjust strategies more flexibly and focus more intently on their own goals without needing to consider others' interests. This independence enables individual investors to find their niche in the market and, through continuous learning and adaptation, ultimately achieve sustained wealth growth.

Obviously, in terms of investment decision-making, it's hard to say that multiple people are necessarily more advantageous than one person. From aspects like decision-making ability, financial capacity, and execution power, individual investors do not have inherent defects.

For example, here are some relative advantages stemming from the political cost advantage:

*   **Adaptability:** Individual investors can at least choose not to participate in certain markets and can choose to learn and adapt to market changes, free from taboos. Institutions often need to maintain established business models, making rapid adjustments difficult.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows individual investors to quickly adjust strategies to adapt to market changes without going through cumbersome approval processes. Institutions often require multi-level approvals, leading to slow responses.
*   **Liquidity:** Individual investors can enter and exit markets almost without restriction, choosing different investment instruments and markets. Institutions are often constrained by capital size and regulatory requirements.

If individual investors can fully utilize these advantages and continuously learn and adapt to the market, they are entirely capable of achieving success in the market. In the AI era, individual investors can use AI tools to quickly compensate for their disadvantages, such as obtaining information, analyzing data, **writing code for trading strategies**, etc., thereby enhancing their advantages. Especially writing code for trading strategies, as mentioned later, systematic trading at the execution level is key to implementing the protracted war. Even if individual investors cannot code themselves, they can use AI to assist in writing code to achieve systematic trading, which is already a proven feasible solution.

### **Refuting the All-in Get-Rich-Quick Theory (Opportunism)**

On the other hand, a minority in the market advocate a "bet it all" strategy, believing that through a one-time high-risk investment, rapid wealth growth can be achieved. This strategy seems to solve the time problem of individual wealth growth but actually ignores the importance of risk management. Those who hold this view and act on it are either novices uninitiated by the market or impoverished gamblers with little left to lose. They often believe their luck can overcome market risks, but reality is often otherwise.

All-in investments often come with enormous risks. Once they fail, they can lead to severe personal wealth loss or even bankruptcy. Moreover, market opportunities are not something everyone can seize; the probability of success is often very low. Therefore, relying solely on an all-in investment strategy cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. Currently, in the MEME market, there are many myths of sudden wealth, with stories of overnight thousand-fold or ten-thousand-fold gains emerging endlessly, attracting a large number of speculators into the market. However, these stories often ignore the underlying risks and failure cases, leading many speculators chasing the dream of sudden wealth to ultimately fall into bankruptcy.

Some people appear to go all-in, but the actual funds they invest each time are not their entire capital but all the funds on their "gambling table." Even if they lose, they have reserves. These are not the holders of the All-in Get-Rich-Quick theory we wish to discuss. However, under certain conditions, such individuals can also become true all-in investors, for example, when the funds on their table are close to their total capital. Those accustomed to all-in investing become increasingly likely to turn into true all-in investors.

Comparatively, most people understand this principle. But when opportunities arise, they are often too quickly overwhelmed by the desire for sudden wealth, transforming into all-in investors. This is the most common mistake individual investors make during the future strategic stalemate phase. It is necessary to prepare psychologically in advance to prevent losing rationality and making wrong decisions when opportunities come.

This is both a crisis and an opportunity. **The more people advocate all-in get-rich-quick, the more it indicates the existence of huge volatility and蕴含的巨大机会 in the market. The more enthusiastic people are about gambling, the more they can perceive the existence of high-volatility markets.** Individual investors need to清醒地认识到 that all-in investment strategies cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. However, if one can适度地利用 all-in strategies under the premise of controllable risk, then individual investors are entirely capable of achieving rapid wealth growth in the market.

### **Refuting the Steady Development Theory (Dogmatism)**

The last, and most classic, view. I criticize it as representative of **dogmatism.** It presents seemingly reasonable arguments to prove that personal wealth growth must rely on steady development strategies. However, this view ignores the time constraint problem of personal wealth growth. There are also many popular sayings, such as "be a friend of time," "the magic of compound interest," etc., which all sound reasonable.

Historically,破除教条主义 has always been difficult because they often wear the cloak of rationality, making it hard to discern their true nature.

The living legend—Warren Buffett, the pioneer of value investing—is the greatest representative of this view. He advocates achieving steady growth of around 20% annually by holding优质资产 long-term. This view is indeed applicable to a certain extent for institutional investors and most individual investors. However, it does not solve **the fundamental contradiction in the problem of individual wealth class transcendence—the conflict between the有限性 of an individual's lifespan and the time required to accumulate wealth.**

In this world, there are many people as long-lived as Buffett, but there is only one "Oracle of Omaha." Many people know and practice value investing. If everyone could develop smoothly如同"熬资历"一般, where would all this extra money come from? If you can accumulate wealth through time, then your predecessors, who came before you, could do so even more. Every individual investor should掂量一下 in their heart whether they have overlooked some blind spot. In this world, are there invisible barriers hindering wealth growth? If so, what are they? If not, why can't most people achieve leapfrog wealth growth?

The fundamental困境 faced by individual investors is:

1.  Wanting steady growth, but steadily growing wealth cannot keep up with逐年增加的生活开支; one总不能不吃不喝地去积累财富.
2.  Wanting to increase accumulation, but accumulation plans are always interrupted by突如其来的风险事件, be it unemployment, illness, or family变故.
3.  Wanting to苟住发展, but social relations催促着必须提升生活质量—buying houses and cars, getting married and having children, maintaining面子工程, etc.
4.  Wanting to搏一搏, but fearing losing existing积累, unable to承受大起大落的风险.

The market has many theories teaching how to make wealth grow steadily, how to avoid risks, and how to earn 10-30% returns annually.
Such strategies include but are not limited to:

*   **Value Investing:** Selecting undervalued优质资产, holding long-term, waiting for the market to correct their prices.
*   **Risk Parity & Permanent Portfolio:** Reducing overall portfolio risk by diversifying across different asset classes and定期再平衡.
*   **Index Investing:** Obtaining the market's average return by investing in market indices, avoiding individual stock risk, and同步 with the broader economic growth of the nation.

If so, by the time assets increase tenfold, it will be ten years later, life will have entered the next stage, and as life becomes increasingly stable, the significance of wealth growth diminishes. If individuals rely solely on steady development strategies for wealth growth, they likely cannot achieve leapfrog wealth growth before their lifespan ends. Moreover, if wealth does not arrive when individuals need it most, when they are old, does pursuing leapfrog wealth growth still hold great significance? Isn't having enough sufficient?

Some may幻想 achieving wealth growth for后代 through inheritance as their own purpose. However, "崽卖爷田不心疼" (descendants selling ancestral land without heartache); this thinking is very unrealistic. Each generation has its own奋斗目标和生活方式. Descendants may not cherish the wealth accumulated by predecessors and might even squander it. Therefore, leaving wealth to the next generation is not necessarily meaningful. Inheritance is meaningful only when both wealth and思想 are passed down.甚至思想的传承 is more important, constituting the main thing.

The scenario for steady development is completely different from that of ordinary people. **I emphasize that I am驳斥 those dogmatic views that advocate steady development under any circumstances.** Refuting the Steady Development theory may sound heretical, but in reality, the Steady Development theory is not a pragmatic choice for individual investors. Individual investors need to清醒地认识到 that the time for wealth growth is limited, and steady development strategies often cannot achieve leapfrog wealth growth within that limited time. Therefore, individual investors need to find a strategy that can achieve wealth growth within a relatively short period, not just rely on steady development strategies.

Of course, contradictions can transform—when personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development strategies become more important because the wealth is then sufficient to support personal living needs. Steady development strategies can help individuals maintain stable wealth growth, avoiding wealth loss due to market volatility. Moreover, as a base for the next round of wealth growth, steady development strategies can provide individuals with a根据地, preparing for another battle for class transcendence.

However, before personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development strategies are not the best choice for individual investors to achieve wealth growth. Individual investors need to find a strategy that can achieve wealth growth within a relatively short period, not just rely on steady development strategies.

## The Protracted War of Capital

When I speak of a protracted war, I do not mean a war protracted in time, but achieving leapfrog wealth growth through a publicly articulable strategy. It consists of several aspects:

1.  Learn to correctly analyze敌我矛盾和形势 to formulate correct strategic guidelines.
2.  Prepare a stable cash flow input, **control the maximum rate of loss**, thereby achieving survival during weakness.
3.  Learn to maintain cumulative advantage, avoid pointless消耗时间 by盯盘, thereby achieving continuous expansion of advantage.
4.  Learn to乘胜追击,决战决胜 at the appropriate时机, not missing historical opportunity windows.
5.  Establish psychological expectations, **accept the possibility of ending up with nothing gained**, thereby avoiding psychological崩溃 due to failure.

### Mathematical Interpretation

This theory has a mathematical interpretation:

First, define the victory condition as wealth reaching a certain value $A$. The goal of all strategies is to achieve this victory condition. This victory condition differs for each person, depending on individual生活需求和财富目标.

Second, assume there exists a strategy $S$, a black-box investment machine. It inputs capital $x$ at time $t_0$ and outputs capital $y$ at time $t_1$. We can define this strategy function with 3 parameters. Once these 3 parameters are determined, the output capital $y$ is determined:

$$
y = S(x, t_0, t_1)
$$

This function is not a mathematical function with an analytical expression but an abstract representation of a black-box investment machine. Its inputs are a time period and capital; its output is capital. Moreover, $x$ in $S$ has an objective domain $[L, U]$, i.e., $L \le x \le U$. This represents the lower and upper limits of investment capital; individual investors cannot invest below $L$ or above $U$. $L$ represents the market's minimum transaction amount, and $U$ represents the market's capital capacity for this strategy.

Clearly, this defines a basic investment concept: between time $t_0$ and $t_1$, investing capital $x$ yields capital $y$. If $y > x$, the strategy is profitable; if $y < x$, it is loss-making.

Now, define our capital curve $F(t)$, representing the total收益 at time $t$. Our goal is for the capital curve $F(t)$ to reach the victory condition $A$ at some moment $T_W$.

$$
\exists_{T_W}  F(T_W) \ge A
$$

Now, at our initial investment moment $T_0$, we first need to define a bottom-line risk control line:

$$F(t) \ge - C \cdot (t - T_0)$$

Here, $C$ is a constant representing the maximum loss rate we can承受. The meaning of this risk control line is that we must ensure that at any time $t$, our capital curve $F(t)$ does not fall below this line. This ensures our survival capability during weakness. The setting of $C$ varies by person, depending on individual cash flow capability. For example, investing 3000 yuan per month means $C = 100$ yuan/day.

An investment action can be defined as using strategy $S$ to invest capital $x$ ($0 < x < A$) during a time period $[t_0, t_1]$, thereby obtaining capital $y$. This action can be expressed as:

$$
F(t_1) = F(t_0) - x + S(x, t_0, t_1)
$$

Our goal is to, through a series of investment actions,最终使得 the capital curve $F(t)$ reaches the victory condition $A$ at some $T_W$, while ensuring that at any time $t$, the capital curve $F(t)$ does not fall below the risk control line.

Furthermore, we can define profit $P(t)$ as the floating profit above the risk control line:

$$
P(t) = F(t) - C \cdot (t - T_0)
$$

You will find that even without any investment action, $P(t)$ grows linearly over time. This is because the risk control line itself declines linearly, while the capital curve $F(t)$ remains unchanged without investment actions. Therefore, $P(t)$ grows linearly over time.

When $P(t)$ reaches $L$, we can use all of $P(t)$ as the investment capital $x = P(t)$ for the next investment action. This is the so-called **scaling with floating profits strategy**.

$$
F(t_1) = F(t_0) - P(t_0) + S(P(t_0), t_0, t_1)
$$

This strategy, under连续盈利的情况下, can achieve rapid growth of the capital curve $F(t)$, thereby achieving leapfrog wealth growth. Because our purpose is to make $F(T_W) \ge A$, there is only one other outcome: $F(t) = -C \cdot t$, meaning the capital curve $F(t)$ directly declines along the risk control line, waiting for the next opportunity.

![Capital Curve Diagram](./images/capital_war.png)

This diagram illustrates a typical path for an individual investor to achieve class-transcending success in the market.

The horizontal axis is time (days), and the vertical axis is net capital F(t).

The diagram contains two key lines:

*   🔴 **Red Risk Control Line** $F(t) = -C \cdot t$: Represents the maximum loss boundary you can承受.
*   🟢 **Green Victory Line** $A = 10^7$: Represents the goal of class transcendence.
*   🔵 **Capital Curve (Blue)** goes through three phases:
    *   **Fail 1:** Starting from the origin, the first attempt fails,亏损触及 the risk control line and stops.
    *   **Fail 2 (Regrettable Failure):** The second attempt briefly突破至 $10^5$ but ultimately falls back to the risk control line due to market reversal. This is the most残酷的情况—you were close to success but功亏一篑 due to未能坚持策略.
    *   **Success:** After sufficient waiting and preparation, finally launching from the risk control line, successfully突破 the victory line $A = 10^7$.

**Core Insight:** Success is not about being right every time, but using controllable small losses to换取 one big victory that transcends class. Most time is spent waiting and试错, striking decisively at critical moments.

Next, for the victory target $A$, strategy $S$, and risk control line parameter $C$, we can construct a new backtesting evaluation system.

Measure how long strategy $S$ takes to achieve victory target $A$, denoted as $T_S(A, C)$. This time $T_S(A, C)$ is a random variable, depending on the performance of strategy $S$ and market volatility. To simplify, assume A = 10 million, C = 100 yuan/day. Evaluation shows that in 5 years of historical data, strategy S on average achieves victory target A once per year. This means you need to定投 100 yuan/day for 1 year to possibly catch one opportunity to earn 10 million. Your cost is 36500 yuan/year, and the收益 is 10 million. Clearly, this is a very划算的投资, and you would be very patient when投入. But what if it happens only once every 5 years? Or once every 10 years? Then it's not划算, and the risk is high. Folks, I'll just say one thing: how many decades does a person have?

Now, based on one's own resources, evaluate the expected time to achieve victory under different conditions, then commit. If deemed unacceptable, do not commit. Then spend time optimizing strategy S, improving its win rate, reducing the time $T_S(A, C)$ needed to achieve victory target A. This process is one of continuous optimization and adjustment until finding a strategy S that can achieve victory target A within an acceptable time frame.

This is the mathematical interpretation of the Protracted War of Capital.

### Practical Rules

It sounds complex, but practical implementation is simple.

1.  **Must prepare a cash flow input.** Use time cost to换取 information and experience advantage. There must be a continuously投入-able, controllable cash flow. This can be salary income or stable interest income. This cash flow need not be large but must be stable. With this cash flow, one can continuously make small investments in the market, accumulating information and experience advantage.
2.  **Must use systematic trading methods** for底层投资操作, avoiding any emotional or humanly unsustainable decisions, preventing纪律性的问题 at the execution stage. Moreover, systematic trading saves individual investors'精力, reducing psychological pressure from懊悔 over保本出局. Do not pursue a fully automatic system, but pursue an imperfect yet省心的盈利 system. **Investors must focus their精力 on designing and optimizing program strategies.** If you cannot code, let AI help. Do not盯盘, do not纠结于 whether to buy or sell in each trade. This does not liberate you; it tortures you. This is the key to what I call advantage accumulation and avoiding pointless消耗.
3.  **Profits must be immediately used to scale positions.** When capital is投入 to a correct direction, profits will quickly appear. Use the scaling with floating profits strategy to continuously扩大优势. Note: there is a very strict stop-loss condition here: if losses reach the level before scaling,必须止损. This is because market volatility clusters; tailwinds and headwinds often cluster. If one can抓住顺风聚集的机会, then one can use the scaling with floating profits strategy to continuously扩大优势. Scaling means your cost line rises, and the space between the cost line and the current net value line constitutes a safety buffer. When the buffer shrinks, if the current "speed" is still too high, the program should trigger position reduction to prevent being穿仓.

This endeavor ultimately has two outcomes: one, successfully achieving leapfrog wealth growth; two, failing with limited loss.
Regardless of the outcome, individual investors can坦然接受 it and learn and grow from it.

### Addressing Common Questions

#### Does the Protracted War of Capital negate the power of compound interest?

**No,恰恰相反. The Protracted War of Capital maximizes the power of compound interest.** Compared to the Protracted War, Buffett's compound interest is extremely conservative. The Protracted War uses controllable losses to bet on potentially enormous returns, achieving leapfrog wealth growth. In this way, the power of compound interest is maximized.

Only末日轮期权, lottery tickets, and prediction markets (like PolyMarket) can achieve similar effects, but market choices are currently still too limited, and pricing is not cheap.

#### What's the difference between the Protracted War of Capital and定期 buying lottery tickets?

The difference from定期 buying lottery tickets is that lottery tickets are purely random events with no controllability. The Protracted War can improve the win rate by refining the strategy, thereby increasing the probability of achieving the victory target. Lottery odds are often fixed, while the Protracted War can continuously adjust and optimize the strategy to improve the win rate.

#### What if everyone adopted the Protracted War of Capital strategy?

Competitive pressure among implementers of the Protracted War cannot be very high. Because only those with the same judgment about market direction at the same moment would form direct competition.

1.  **Different Strategic Purposes.** Those not aiming for class transcendence would not adopt the Protracted War strategy. A significant number of people would adopt steady growth strategies to maintain stable wealth growth. Their existence also reduces competitive pressure on the Protracted War strategy. Their existence can actually serve as counterparties, creating victory opportunities for us.
2.  **Diversity of Strategy S.** Strategy S is private; different people很难采取完全相同的 strategy S. Even similar strategies S would yield different results due to different parameters. This diversity means implementers of the Protracted War strategy不会形成直接的竞争关系. However, some crowding effect still exists.
3.  **Differences in Victory Target A and Risk Control Parameter C.** These two parameters determine the启动速率 of scaling. This leads to differences in actual investment力度 among different investors at the same point in time, differentiating their performance.

Market opportunities change dynamically; different strategies S will obtain different opportunities at different times. The market will scatter these opportunities, forming a dynamic ecosystem.

#### How to determine the cash flow C?

First, one must correctly understand margin and leverage.

A practical question: if one拿出 6000 yuan per month, approximately 200 yuan/day investment额度, what can one buy? Almost nothing.

This misunderstands the concept of cash flow; it is to cover losses. For example, buying one lot requires 10,000 yuan. Your 200 yuan cash flow means you can accept a 2% loss rate per day, which is actually not insignificant. If the loss exceeds this speed, you need to actively exit the market to prevent excessive losses.

This differs from another investment style: saving tens of thousands over several months, investing it all at once, setting no stop-loss,不敢认输 when losing, watching one's底线被市场摁在地上摩擦; when profiting,拼命加仓,生怕赶不上发财的机会, ending up架在山顶,活脱脱成了山顶资本. This is a completely失控的状态,可叹.

Determining position size based on potential loss is a basic fund management concept. For this,学好小学数学, correctly solving word problems, is necessary.

#### Difference from "Heavy Betting When Seeing an Opportunity"

The Protracted War strategy does not rely on subjective "seeing an opportunity" but on the objective rule of "scaling with floating profits."

It does not rely on an artistic subjective judgment but on a mechanical objective rule. The executor only needs to follow the rule, waiting for opportunities to arrive, without needing to judge whether opportunities exist. The executor must be a program system, avoiding human emotional interference.

Furthermore, in the Protracted War strategy,投入重注 is实际上不允许 without floating profits. Heavy betting is only allowed when there are floating profits. This is because floating profits represent the market's认可 of strategy S. Heavy betting without floating profits often leads to excessive, un承受-able losses.

Below the risk control line falls into the realm of机会主义 with失控 risk. This is what the Protracted War aims to avoid.

#### Relationship between the Protracted War and Steady Growth?

They are mutually transformative.
The key is that investors must clearly define their strategic objectives.

After achieving leapfrog wealth growth, individual investors can choose to转移部分资金 to steady growth strategies to maintain stable wealth growth. Steady growth strategies can help individual investors avoid wealth loss due to market volatility, achieving long-term stable wealth growth. Steady growth strategies can serve as a base for the next round of wealth growth, providing individual investors with a根据地, preparing for another battle for class transcendence.

## Summary

The key takeaways are:

The framework remains constant; strategies can be changed. The core is using controllable losses to换取 uncertain large returns.

1.  Start with cash flow, control the loss rate to achieve survival during weakness.
2.  Use systematic trading to avoid emotional decisions, achieving continuous expansion of advantage.
3.  Utilize scaling with floating profits to乘胜追击, achieving leapfrog wealth growth. Even if it fails, the loss equals the loss before scaling,不会击穿现金流.

The specific systematic strategy is the decisive key to victory. The core of this article lies in重新定义了胜利的目标和评判标准, thereby providing individual investors with a feasible strategic path to achieve leapfrog wealth growth.

Please look forward to my subsequent articles, which will propose a specific testing framework to verify the feasibility of this theory. Let's see whether当年我仓加少了, or the strategy还不够好. One of these two must have a conclusion.

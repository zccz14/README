# From the Battlefield to Digital Space: The Inspirational Significance of Su Yu's Combat Directives for a New Era Multi-Agent System Collaboration Framework

2026-01-14

**Abstract**: This paper aims to explore a cross-historical, methodological-level transplantation and innovation. By deeply analyzing the core characteristics and organizational logic of the combat directives used by the outstanding Chinese military strategist Su Yu in large-scale operations, this paper abstracts the universal principles of command and control for complex systems underlying them. Subsequently, these principles are applied to the design of collaborative frameworks for new-era multi-agent systems, proposing a model named the **"Multi-Agent Collaborative Combat Directive Framework for Complex Tasks"**. This framework emphasizes **global situational alignment, task structural decoupling, standardized interaction protocols, and central dynamic coordination**, aiming to address current challenges in multi-agent systems regarding collaborative efficiency, intent alignment, and task reliability. This study demonstrates that exceptional traditional organizational management wisdom can provide profound insights beyond technology—specifically on "how to organize effectively"—for the development of artificial intelligence, particularly embodied intelligence and swarm intelligence.

## **I. Introduction**

- **Research Background**: With the advancement of large language model technology, multi-agent systems have become a frontier paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, current agent collaboration often faces issues such as scattered goals, inefficient communication, and uncontrollable outcomes, which are essentially systemic engineering challenges of **"how to organize effectively"**.
- **Problem Statement**: Do mature cross-domain paradigms exist that can provide high-level organizational methodologies for AI multi-agent collaboration?
- **Research Entry Point**: The art of Su Yu's command in large-scale operations, as the pinnacle of human practice in managing large-scale collaboration under extremely complex and dynamically uncertain environments, holds immense research value. The organizational logic crystallized in his combat directives is particularly worthy of study.
- **Research Significance**: Facilitating an interdisciplinary dialogue between historical military wisdom and AI technology can not only provide novel inspiration for AI system design but also reinterpret and transmit classic military thought from a new perspective.

## **II. Deconstructing the Core Characteristics and Organizational Logic of Su Yu's Combat Directives**

This chapter deconstructs Su Yu's combat directives (exemplified by orders from the Eastern Henan and Huaihai Campaigns) from historical documents into a **complex system control methodology**.

1.  **Structural Characteristics: Standardization and Modularity**
    - **Mandatory Format**: The fixed modules of "Enemy Situation - Our Situation - Decision - Deployment - Coordination - Support" are not rigid "eight-legged essays" but rather a **forcing function** ensuring information completeness and reducing cognitive load.
    - **Atomic Information**: Directive content is highly specific (time, location, unit, task degree), ensuring executability, verifiability, and lack of ambiguity.

2.  **Organizational Logic: Precise Mapping from Intent to Action**
    - **Global Situational Alignment**: Through the "Enemy Situation Assessment" section, it ensures all execution units have a unified, clear understanding of the battlefield, achieving **"unified thinking"**.
    - **Goal Layering and Task Decoupling**: "Decision and Objective" clarifies primary and secondary goals; "Deployment" decomposes the overall objective into independent, specialized subtasks for each unit (main attack, blocking reinforcements, reserve force), achieving **functional decoupling and responsibility focus**.
      \*. **Pre-positioned Coordination Protocols**: "Coordination Matters" detail rules for timing, spatial coordination, communication, and firepower cooperation, essentially pre-setting **interaction protocols** between units, transforming coordination from "ad-hoc negotiation" to "synchronization according to plan."
    - **Resilience and Fault Tolerance Design**: The setup of reserve forces and anticipation of contingencies reflect the embedding of **dynamic response capabilities** within a rigid plan.

3.  **Core Principles Extracted**:
    - **Principle One: Cognitive Unity First** (Unify Thinking).
    - **Principle Two: Structure Determines Function** (Modular Division of Labor).
    - **Principle Three: Protocol Over Communication** (Standardized Coordination).
    - **Principle Four: Distributed Execution Under Centralized Command** (Division of Authority and Responsibility between Headquarters and Columns).

## **III. Constructing an Application Model of the "Su-Style Framework" in Multi-Agent Systems**

Based on the principles extracted in Chapter II, a collaborative framework applicable to AI multi-agent systems is constructed.

1.  **Model Overview**: Proposes the **"Multi-Agent Collaborative Combat Directive Framework"**, viewing the task publisher as the **"Headquarters"**, the task itself as the **"Campaign"**, and each AI agent as a **"Military Branch/Unit"**.
2.  **Core Module Design**:
    - **Situation and Problem Analysis Module**: Generated by a `Situation Awareness Agent`, equivalent to "Enemy Situation Assessment", aligning all agents' understanding of the task background, difficulties, and constraints.
    - **System Goals and Success Criteria Module**: Clearly defines the "strategic purpose" of the task and measurable "tactical indicators".
    - **Agent Roles and Task Assignment Module**: Precisely defines the role of each Agent (e.g., `Researcher`, `Analyst`, `Writer`, `Reviewer`) and issues specific, atomic action instructions.
    - **Inter-Agent Interaction Protocol Module**: Specifies workflow sequence, data exchange formats (e.g., JSON Schema), synchronization trigger conditions, and conflict resolution rules.
    - **Central Coordination and Monitoring Unit**: The `Command Coordination Agent` acts as the "Headquarters", responsible for generating initial directives, monitoring the process, handling exceptions, and consolidating outputs, achieving **"centralized command"**.

## **IV. Analysis of Su Yu's Combat Directive Examples and Their Migration to AI Agent Collaboration**

### **1. Analysis of a Classic Su Yu Combat Directive Example**

To intuitively demonstrate the paradigm of Su Yu's combat directives, we use the core parts of the **operational order for the first phase of the Eastern Henan Campaign, the "Kaifeng Campaign" (June 1948)** as a blueprint for structured analysis. While not a verbatim reproduction, it is reconstructed strictly based on the recorded spirit and format of the historical directive.

**Simulated Reconstruction of Core Directive Parts:**

> **East China Field Army Kaifeng Campaign Operational Order (Excerpt)**
>
> **I. Comprehensive Assessment of Current Enemy Situation**
>
> 1.  **Enemy Reorganized 66th Division** main force garrisoned in Kaifeng city proper. Its 13th Brigade defends Caoguan and Songmen, the 185th Brigade defends the line from West Gate to North Gate, with division headquarters and direct units at the Longting core position. Fortifications are strong, but forces are dispersed, with gaps present.
> 2.  **Part of the Enemy Reorganized 68th Division** is located in the Chenliu area east of Kaifeng; the main force of **Qiu Qingquan's Corps** is still lingering west of Shangqiu. It is assessed that reinforcing Kaifeng would require at least 3 days.
> 3.  **Overall Enemy Disposition**: Defensive forces along the Longhai Railway are in isolated strongpoints; Qiu's Corps is hesitant. The enemy has not yet discerned our army's true intent.
>
> **II. Our Army's Campaign Decision and Objective**
>
> 1.  **Campaign Decision**: Use sudden, swift action to catch the enemy in Kaifeng off guard, aiming to annihilate the Reorganized 66th Division within the city.
> 2.  **Primary Objective**: Capture Kaifeng, annihilate defending enemy forces, disrupt the enemy's Central Plains defense system.
> 3.  **Secondary Objective**: Draw Qiu Qingquan's Corps westward in reinforcement, creating opportunities to annihilate enemy forces in motion in the next phase.
>
> **III. Specific Tasks and Deployment for Each Unit**
>
> 1.  **3rd Column (reinforced with main artillery of the Specialized Arms Column)**:
>     - **Task**: Main attack. Responsible for attacking and annihilating enemy forces at Caoguan, Songmen, and South Gate. After breaking into the city, conduct deep penetration towards the enemy's Longting core position.
>     - **Deployment**: With one division reinforced by artillery, complete concealed attack preparations against Caoguan and Songmen before dusk on Day X. After the general assault begins, must open a breach within 4 hours.
> 2.  **8th Column**:
>     - **Task**: Supporting attack and blocking. Responsible for attacking and annihilating enemy forces in the West Gate periphery, and resolutely blocking any enemy reinforcements possibly arriving from the Zhongmou direction.
>     - **Deployment**: Main force of two divisions for West Gate attack; one regiment-sized unit constructs blocking positions to the east. Attack initiation time fully synchronized with the 3rd Column.
> 3.  **1st, 4th, 6th Columns (Campaign General Reserve and Reinforcement-Engagement Group)**:
>     - **Task**: Concealed assembly in the area southeast of Kaifeng, closely monitoring movements of Qiu Qingquan's Corps.
>     - **Deployment**: If enemy reinforcements move out, execute mobile blocking per Plan One (XX area); if the Kaifeng battle proceeds smoothly, join the city assault or prepare for next-phase operations as the situation dictates.
>
> **IV. Coordination Matters**
>
> 1.  **Time Coordination**: General assault initiation time set for 20:00 hours on Day X. All unit operational clocks to be synchronized with Field Army Headquarters by 18:00 hours.
> 2.  **Firepower Coordination**: Initial intense fire preparation concentrated on three points: Caoguan, Songmen, West Gate, lasting 30 minutes. Signal for artillery fire extension is three red flares.
> 3.  **Communication Liaison**: During the assault, primary radio channel is "Yellow River", backup channel is "Songshan". Assault forces and blocking forces to exchange daily recognition passwords.
>
> **V. Command Post Location**
> Field Army Forward Command Post to be established at XX village southeast of Kaifeng by 18:00 hours on Day X. Locations of regimental-level and above command posts of all units must be reported promptly.

### **2. Migration Example of Su-Style Directive Logic to AI Multi-Agent Collaboration**

We fully migrate the directive logic of the above "Kaifeng Campaign" to a complex AI task: **"Generate an urgent strategic analysis report for the company's decision-making layer on 'How to Respond to Competitor A Company's Newly Launched Product X'"**.

**Final Output Requirements**: The report must include three parts: market impact analysis, our SWOT response, and specific action recommendations. Data must be latest, viewpoints sharp, recommendations actionable, within 2000 words.

### **3. Summary of Migration Logic**

Through the above example comparison and migration, the transformation mapping of Su Yu's combat directive paradigm to AI multi-agent collaboration becomes clear:

1.  **"Enemy Situation Assessment" → "Situation and Task Analysis"**: Transforms the ambiguous fog of war into clear problem definition and constraint identification, achieving **unified cognitive starting point**.
2.  **"Force Deployment" → "Role and Task Assignment"**: Deconstructs the abstract "write a report" task into specific, parallelizable or sequential atomic tasks, assigned to specialized agents, achieving **functional decoupling and specialization**.
3.  **"Coordination Matters" → "Interaction Protocols"**: Transforms coordination reliant on ad-hoc communication into pre-set, standardized data interfaces and process rules, achieving **efficient, unambiguous machine-to-machine collaboration**.
4.  **"Command Post/Reserve Force" → "Central Coordination and Monitoring"**: Introduces a system-level **meta-cognition and management layer** responsible for exception handling, quality control, and resource scheduling, ensuring system **robustness**.

The core of this migration is transforming **the art of human command of large formations into the "operating system-level" scheduling and management logic for machine agent clusters**. This enables multi-agent systems not only to "do work" but also to "collaborate in combat" like a disciplined army to accomplish a complex strategic objective. This marks a new level for AI collaboration, moving from "tool application" to **"task engineering"** and **"organizational management"**.

### **V. Comparative Analysis and Advantage Elaboration**

Compared to traditional prompt engineering and simple linear workflows, the advantages of this framework precisely reflect the transferred value of "Su-Style Wisdom":

1.  **From "Heuristic Dialogue" to "Systematic Engineering"**: Transforms temporary, vague prompts into structured, reusable collaborative blueprints.
2.  **From "Simple Summation" to "Emergent Collaboration"**: Through pre-positioned interaction protocols, agents generate synergistic "1+1>2" effects, avoiding work overlap and information silos.
3.  **Enhanced Robustness and Explainability**: Central monitoring and reserve mechanisms improve system fault tolerance; the standardized directive structure makes the entire reasoning and execution process **white-boxed**, facilitating traceability and debugging.
4.  **Improved Complex Task Tackling Capability**: This framework is particularly suitable for complex task scenarios requiring deep research, multi-step reasoning, and strict quality requirements, achieving "campaign-level" decomposition and control of complex tasks.

### **VI. Conclusion and Outlook**

1.  **Main Conclusion**: The organizational wisdom embodied in Su Yu's combat directives—**standardization, modularity, protocolization, and resilience**—provides a highly inspiring high-level framework for solving multi-agent system collaboration problems. This proves that while pursuing technological limits, drawing nourishment from the accumulated organizational management thought of human civilization is an effective path for innovation.
2.  **Theoretical Value**: Opens a new interdisciplinary perspective for artificial intelligence research, especially swarm intelligence and embodied intelligence: **"Organizational Behavior and AI System Design"**.
3.  **Practical Outlook**:
    - **Short-term**: A prototype of this framework can be implemented on existing agent orchestration platforms, and its efficacy validated in complex tasks (e.g., industry research report generation, competitive analysis, software project design).
    - **Long-term**: This thinking can be further extended to broader fields such as **multi-robot collaboration in the physical world** and **mixed human-machine team collaboration**, providing a theoretical foundation for building intelligent systems with strategic-level task execution capabilities.
4.  **Final Remarks**: From the command post of the Huaihai Campaign to the AI laboratory, the spark of wisdom across time and space indicates that **how to organize complexity efficiently is an eternal proposition faced by both humanity and artificial intelligence**. Su Yu's command art is precisely a bridge connecting history and the future, shining with methodological brilliance.

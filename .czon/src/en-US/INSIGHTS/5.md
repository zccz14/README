# From Battlefield to Digital Space: The Inspirational Significance of Su Yu's Combat Directives for a New Era Multi-Agent System Coordination Framework

2026-01-14

**Abstract**: This article aims to explore a cross-historical, methodological-level transplantation and innovation. Through an in-depth analysis of the core characteristics and organizational logic of the large-scale combat directives of Su Yu, an outstanding military strategist of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, this article abstracts the universal principles of command and control for complex systems underlying them. Subsequently, these principles are applied to the design of a coordination framework for new-era multi-agent systems, proposing a model named the **"Multi-Agent Coordinated Combat Directive Framework for Complex Tasks."** This framework emphasizes **global situation alignment, structural task decoupling, standardized interaction protocols, and central dynamic coordination**, aiming to address current challenges in multi-agent systems regarding coordination efficiency, intent alignment, and task reliability. This study demonstrates that exceptional traditional organizational management wisdom can provide profound insights beyond technology—specifically on "how to organize effectively"—for the development of artificial intelligence, particularly embodied and swarm intelligence.

## **I. Introduction**

- **Research Background**: With the advancement of large language model technology, multi-agent systems have become a frontier paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, current agent coordination often faces issues such as scattered goals, inefficient communication, and uncontrollable outcomes, which are essentially systemic engineering challenges of **"how to organize effectively."**
- **Problem Statement**: Do mature cross-domain paradigms exist that can provide high-level organizational methodologies for AI multi-agent coordination?
- **Research Entry Point**: Su Yu's art of large-scale combat command, as the pinnacle of human practice in managing large-scale coordination under extremely complex and dynamically uncertain environments, possesses immense research value. The organizational logic crystallized in his combat directives is particularly worthy of study.
- **Research Significance**: Facilitating an interdisciplinary dialogue between historical military wisdom and AI technology can not only provide novel inspiration for AI system design but also reinterpret and transmit classic military thought from a new perspective.

## **II. Deconstructing the Core Characteristics and Organizational Logic of Su Yu's Combat Directives**

This chapter deconstructs Su Yu's combat directives (exemplified by orders from the Eastern Henan and Huaihai Campaigns) from historical documents into a **complex system control methodology**.

1.  **Structural Characteristics: Standardization and Modularization**

    - **Mandatory Format**: The fixed modules of "Enemy Situation - Our Situation - Decision - Deployment - Coordination - Support" are not rigid "eight-legged essays" but rather a **forcing function** ensuring information completeness and reducing cognitive load.
    - **Atomic Information**: Directive content is highly specific (time, location, unit, task degree), ensuring executability, verifiability, and lack of ambiguity.

2.  **Organizational Logic: Precise Mapping from Intent to Action**

    - **Global Situation Alignment**: Through the "Enemy Situation Assessment" section, it ensures all execution units have a unified, clear understanding of the battlefield, achieving **"unified thinking."**
    - **Goal Layering and Task Decoupling**: "Decision and Objective" clarifies primary and secondary goals; "Deployment" decomposes the overall objective into independent, specialized subtasks for each unit (main attack, blocking reinforcements, reserve force), achieving **functional decoupling and responsibility focus**.
      \*. **Pre-positioned Coordination Protocols**: "Coordination Matters" detail rules for time, space, communication, and firepower coordination, essentially pre-establishing **interaction protocols** between units, transforming coordination from "ad-hoc coordination" to "synchronization according to plan."
    - **Flexibility and Fault Tolerance Design**: The setup of reserve forces and anticipation of contingencies reflect the embedding of **dynamic response capability** within rigid plans.

3.  **Core Principles Extracted**:
    - **Principle One: Cognitive Unity First** (Unify Thinking).
    - **Principle Two: Structure Determines Function** (Modular Division of Labor).
    - **Principle Three: Protocol Over Communication** (Standardized Coordination).
    - **Principle Four: Distributed Execution Under Centralized Command** (Division of Authority and Responsibility between Headquarters and Columns).

## **III. Constructing an Application Model of the "Su-Style Framework" in Multi-Agent Systems**

Based on the principles extracted in Chapter II, a coordination framework applicable to AI multi-agent systems is constructed.

1.  **Model Overview**: Proposes the **"Multi-Agent Coordinated Combat Directive Framework,"** where the task publisher is regarded as the **"Headquarters,"** the task itself as the **"Campaign,"** and each AI agent as a **"Military Branch/Unit."**
2.  **Core Module Design**:
    - **Situation and Problem Analysis Module**: Generated by a `Situation Awareness Agent`, equivalent to "Enemy Situation Assessment," aligning all agents' understanding of the task background, difficulties, and constraints.
    - **System Goal and Success Criteria Module**: Clearly defines the "strategic purpose" of the task and measurable "tactical indicators."
    - **Agent Role and Task Assignment Module**: Precisely defines each Agent's role (e.g., `Researcher`, `Analyst`, `Writer`, `Reviewer`) and issues specific, atomic action instructions.
    - **Inter-Agent Interaction Protocol Module**: Specifies workflow sequence, data exchange formats (e.g., JSON Schema), synchronization trigger conditions, and conflict resolution rules.
    - **Central Coordination and Monitoring Unit**: The `Command Coordination Agent` acts as the "Headquarters," responsible for generating initial instructions, monitoring the process, handling exceptions, and aggregating outputs, realizing **"centralized command."**

## **IV. Analysis of Su Yu's Combat Directive Examples and Their Migration to AI Agent Coordination**

### **1. Analysis of a Classic Su Yu Combat Directive Example**

To intuitively demonstrate the paradigm of Su Yu's combat directives, we use the core parts of the **operational order for the first phase of the Eastern Henan Campaign, the "Kaifeng Campaign" (June 1948)** as a blueprint for structured analysis. While not a verbatim reproduction, it is reconstructed strictly based on the directive's spirit and format as recorded in military history.

**Simulated Reconstruction of Core Directive Parts:**

> **East China Field Army Kaifeng Campaign Operational Order (Excerpt)**
>
> **I. Comprehensive Assessment of Current Enemy Situation**
>
> 1.  **Enemy Reorganized 66th Division** main force garrisoned in Kaifeng urban area, its 13th Brigade defending Cao Pass and Song Gate, 185th Brigade defending the line from West Gate to North Gate, division headquarters and direct units located at the Longting core position. Fortifications are strong, but forces are dispersed, with gaps present.
> 2.  **Part of Enemy Reorganized 68th Division** located in Chenliu area east of Kaifeng; **Qiu Qingquan Corps** main force still lingering west of Shangqiu. Assessed that reinforcement of Kaifeng would require at least 3 days.
> 3.  **Overall Enemy Posture**: Longhai Railway defense forces are isolated strongpoints; Qiu Corps is hesitant. The enemy has not yet discerned our army's true intent.
>
> **II. Our Army's Campaign Decision and Objective**
>
> 1.  **Campaign Decision**: Use sudden, swift action to catch the enemy in Kaifeng off guard, aiming to annihilate the Reorganized 66th Division within the urban area.
> 2.  **Primary Objective**: Capture Kaifeng, annihilate defending enemy forces, disrupt the enemy's Central Plains defense system.
> 3.  **Secondary Objective**: Draw the Qiu Qingquan Corps westward as reinforcements, creating opportunities to annihilate enemy forces in motion in the next phase.
>
> **III. Specific Tasks and Deployment for Each Unit**
>
> 1.  **3rd Column (with main artillery of Specialized Forces Column attached)**:
>     - **Task**: Main attack. Responsible for attacking and annihilating enemy forces at Cao Pass, Song Gate, and South Gate. After breaking into the urban area, conduct deep penetration towards the enemy core position at Longting.
>     - **Deployment**: With one division reinforced by artillery, complete concealed attack preparations against Cao Pass and Song Gate before dusk on X day. After the general attack commences, must open a breach within 4 hours.
> 2.  **8th Column**:
>     - **Task**: Supporting attack and blocking. Responsible for attacking and annihilating enemy forces in the West Gate periphery and resolutely blocking potential enemy reinforcements from the Zhongmou direction.
>     - **Deployment**: Main force of two divisions for West Gate attack; one regimental-sized unit constructs blocking positions to the east. Attack commencement time fully synchronized with 3rd Column.
> 3.  **1st, 4th, 6th Columns (Campaign General Reserve and Reinforcement Blocking Group)**:
>     - **Task**: Concealed assembly in the area southeast of Kaifeng, closely monitoring movements of Qiu Qingquan Corps.
>     - **Deployment**: If enemy reinforcements move out, execute mobile blocking per Plan One (XX area); if Kaifeng battle proceeds smoothly, join the攻城 as situation dictates or prepare for next phase operations.
>
> **IV. Coordination Matters**
>
> 1.  **Time Coordination**: General attack commencement time set for 20:00 hours on X day. All unit operational clocks to be synchronized with Field Army Headquarters before 18:00 hours.
> 2.  **Firepower Coordination**: Initial concentrated fire assault focused on three points: Cao Pass, Song Gate, West Gate, lasting 30 minutes. Signal for artillery fire extension is three red flares.
> 3.  **Communication Liaison**: During攻城, primary radio channel is "Yellow River," backup channel is "Song Mountain."攻城 forces and blocking forces to exchange identification passwords once daily.
>
> **V. Command Post Location**
> Field Army Forward Command Post to be established at XX village southeast of Kaifeng before 18:00 hours on X day. Positions of regimental-level and above command posts of all units must be reported promptly.

### **2. Migration Example of Su-Style Directive Logic to AI Multi-Agent Coordination**

We fully migrate the directive logic of the above "Kaifeng Campaign" to a complex AI task: **"Generate an urgent strategic analysis report for the company's decision-making layer on 'How to Respond to Competitor A Company's Newly Launched Product X'."**

**Final Output Requirements**: The report must include three parts: market impact analysis, our SWOT response, and specific action recommendations. Data must be latest, viewpoints sharp, recommendations actionable, within 2000 words.

### **3. Summary of Migration Logic**

Through the above example comparison and migration, the transformation mapping of Su Yu's combat directive paradigm to AI multi-agent coordination becomes clear:

1.  **"Enemy Situation Assessment" → "Situation and Task Analysis"**: Transforms the模糊的 battlefield fog into clear problem definition and constraint identification, achieving **unified cognitive starting point**.
2.  **"Force Deployment" → "Role and Task Assignment"**: Deconstructs the abstract "write a report" task into specific, parallelizable or serializable atomic tasks, assigned to specialized agents, achieving **functional decoupling and specialization**.
3.  **"Coordination Matters" → "Interaction Protocols"**: Transforms coordination reliant on ad-hoc communication into pre-established, standardized data interfaces and process rules, achieving **efficient, unambiguous machine-to-machine collaboration**.
4.  **"Command Post/Reserve Force" → "Central Coordination and Monitoring"**: Introduces a system-level **meta-cognition and management layer** responsible for exception handling, quality control, and resource调度, ensuring system **robustness**.

The core of this migration is transforming **the art of human command of large forces into the "operating system-level" scheduling and management logic for machine agent clusters**, enabling multi-agent systems not only to "work" but also to "coordinate and fight" like a disciplined army to accomplish a complex strategic objective. This marks the advancement of AI coordination from "tool application" to a new level of **"task engineering"** and **"organizational management."**

### **V. Comparative Analysis and Advantage Elaboration**

Compared to traditional prompt engineering and simple linear workflows, the advantages of this framework precisely reflect the migrated value of "Su-style wisdom":

1.  **From "Heuristic Dialogue" to "Systematic Engineering"**: Transforms临时,模糊的 prompts into structured, reusable coordination blueprints.
2.  **From "Simple Summation" to "Emergent Coordination"**: Through pre-positioned interaction protocols, agents generate "1+1>2" chemical reactions, avoiding work overlap and information silos.
3.  **Enhanced Robustness and Explainability**: Central monitoring and reserve mechanisms improve system fault tolerance; standardized directive structure makes the entire reasoning and execution process **white-boxed**, easy to trace and debug.
4.  **Improved Ability to Tackle Complex Tasks**: This framework is particularly suitable for complex task scenarios requiring deep research, multi-step reasoning, and strict quality requirements, achieving "campaign-level" decomposition and control of complex tasks.

### **VI. Conclusion and Outlook**

1.  **Main Conclusion**: The organizational wisdom embodied in Su Yu's combat directives—**standardization, modularization, protocolization, and flexibility**—provides a highly inspiring high-level framework for solving multi-agent system coordination problems. This proves that while pursuing technological limits, drawing nourishment from the accumulated organizational management ideas of human civilization is an effective innovation path.
2.  **Theoretical Value**: Opens a new interdisciplinary perspective for artificial intelligence research, particularly swarm intelligence and embodied intelligence: **"Organizational Behavior and AI System Design."**
3.  **Practical Outlook**:
    - **Short-term**: A prototype of this framework can be implemented on existing agent orchestration platforms, and its efficacy validated in complex tasks (e.g., industry research report generation, competitor analysis, software project design).
    - **Long-term**: This thinking can be further extended to broader fields such as **multi-robot coordination in the physical world** and **mixed human-machine team collaboration**, providing a theoretical basis for building intelligent systems with strategic-level task execution capabilities.
4.  **Final Remarks**: From the command post of the Huaihai Campaign to the AI laboratory, the spark of wisdom across time and space shows that **how to organize complexity efficiently is an eternal proposition faced jointly by humans and artificial intelligence**. Su Yu's command art is precisely a bridge connecting history and the future, shining with methodological brilliance.

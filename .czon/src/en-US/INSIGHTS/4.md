# From Creation to Distribution — Building an AI-Native Content Engine

2026-01-10

In summary, it boils down to one sentence: **Deep Creation, Shallow Distribution.**

Content originates from thought, thought originates from observation. The process of content creation is a continuous deepening from superficial observation (perception) to deep thought (cognition).
The process of content distribution, on the other hand, is about conveying this thought to the audience, prompting them to make new observations and thoughts. At this stage, one must learn to distribute shallowly, avoiding information overload and allowing the audience to easily access and understand the content.

Any technology, including SEO and recommendation algorithms, serves the efficient transmission of information. Doing this well naturally leads to good data performance. This can be considered the first principle of content creation and distribution.

In the past, content creation and distribution primarily relied on human creativity and labor.

Now, AI has arrived.

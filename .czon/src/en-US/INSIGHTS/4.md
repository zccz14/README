# From Creation to Distribution – Building an AI-Native Content Engine

2026-01-10

To summarize in one sentence: **Go deep in creation, come out simple in distribution.**

Content originates from thought, and thought originates from observation. The process of content creation is a continuous journey from superficial observation (perception) to deep thought (cognition).
The process of content distribution, on the other hand, involves conveying this thought to the audience, prompting them to engage in new observation and thinking. At this stage, one must learn to distribute content in a simple, accessible manner, avoiding information overload and allowing the audience to easily acquire and understand the content.

Any technology, including SEO and recommendation algorithms, serves the purpose of efficient information transmission. Do this well, and the data will naturally look good. This can be considered the first principle of content creation and distribution.

In the past, content creation and distribution primarily relied on human creativity and labor.

Now, AI has arrived.

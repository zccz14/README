It is now January 9, 2026, early morning.

I'm currently thinking about CZON's custom theme feature, having previously decided to implement it using JSX.

If we use JSX, the interface becomes URL -> State -> HTML.

The URL remains important because ultimately we need to render static HTML files. For SEO considerations, URLs are still necessary.
Furthermore, the main part of the URL is the Path, not the Query/Hash, as those cannot be translated into static files due to their high dynamism.

Therefore, the URL, especially the Path, will still be a core concept of CZON.

React posits that UI = f(State), and JSX is the representation of that function f.

So, the problems CZON needs to address are:

1.  Which URLs are accessible?
    1.  All Markdown files. For displaying article content.
    2.  List/index pages, primarily to display other URLs under a certain criterion, such as categories, tags, archives, etc.
    3.  Other special pages.

2.  What is the State corresponding to each URL?
    Regardless of the URL type, the State can always be designed to be global.
    Even for article pages, the list of all articles can be passed in, though only the current article is rendered.

3.  How to render HTML based on the State?
    This is the responsibility of JSX. JSX components receive the State as Props, return React Elements, which are then rendered into HTML by ReactDOMServer. If necessary, hydration is performed on the client side.

Thus, CZON's theme system is essentially a set of JSX components that receive the State provided by CZON and render it into HTML... This feels no different from a modern React-based static site generator. 🤔 Can I really compete with already mature solutions?

There are many mature solutions for SSG (Static Site Generator) that combine React and Markdown, such as Next.js, Gatsby, Astro, Docusaurus, Nextra, VitePress, etc.
These solutions are already very mature and feature-rich. Why reinvent the wheel?

However, CZON also has its own unique aspects, primarily concentrated in AI integration:

**Native Language Writing, Automatic Translation**

One of CZON's core selling points is supporting content creation in a native language, with automatic AI translation into multiple language versions.
This is not common in existing SSGs. While some plugins can achieve similar functionality, CZON can integrate this more seamlessly.

**Automatic Extraction of Document Metadata**

CZON can automatically extract metadata from documents, such as titles, summaries, keywords, etc., which is very helpful for SEO and content management. Users can act as writers, with a professional AI assistant tirelessly handling these mundane tasks.

**Intelligent Content Generation and Optimization** (TODO)

Although CZON doesn't have this feature yet, it could integrate AI in the future to help generate content, optimize SEO, or even dynamically adjust content based on user behavior. For example, AI could review article readability, provide improvement suggestions, or generate related multimedia content (like images, videos).

**Intelligent Distribution and Recommendation** (TODO)

Content that better implants itself in the reader's mind is more valuable. All content creators understand this deeply. While creating beautiful frameworks and themes is important, producing content that attracts readers is paramount. CZON needs to consider how to close the loop between content creation and distribution, allowing AI to help authors better reach their audience. For example, one-click generation of promotional copy tailored for specific social media platforms, or recommending related articles based on reader interests.

In summary, while CZON overlaps with existing SSGs in some aspects, it has unique advantages in AI integration and content management. Therefore, continuing to develop CZON as an independent tool makes sense. However, it's important to note that CZON should focus on its unique selling points rather than trying to reinvent already mature wheels. For now, functionality is key; perfection is not the goal.

Consequently, I have decided to temporarily pause the development of CZON's custom theme feature and instead focus on perfecting its core functionalities, especially the distinctive features related to AI integration and content management. This saves effort. Once CZON's core features are more stable, we can reconsider whether to introduce custom themes or directly integrate with existing SSGs.

In the future, I will write a dedicated article to define CZON's positioning and target user base, clarifying its differences and advantages compared to existing SSGs.

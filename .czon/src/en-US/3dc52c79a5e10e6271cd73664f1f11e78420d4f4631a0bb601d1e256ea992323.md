"title": "AI Analysis Report: Historical Time Span Style"
"summary": "This report analyzes the evolution of ideas across 25 documents from January 5th to 18th, 2026, from a historical development perspective. It traces the thematic progression from technical issues (e.g., module-level human-AI collaborative architecture, controllable trust theory) to product issues (e.g., CZON brand establishment, AI coding practice adjustments), and then to strategic issues (e.g., capital protracted warfare, influence formula). Key findings include the triangular structure of the ideological system (controllable trust, modular collaboration, theory of limitations), the iterative pattern between theory and practice, interdisciplinary migration (e.g., the application of Su Yu's military thought to multi-agent systems), and persistent themes such as seeking optimality within constraints, systematic thinking, and long-termism. The report concludes that the project is currently transitioning from technical exploration to commercialization and points out potential future directions and risks."

## Introduction: The Imprint of Time

Words are the fossils of time.

When we read these documents in January 2026, we see not only the content of ideas but also their trajectories. From the first INSIGHT on January 5th, 2026, to the latest log on January 18th, a universe of thought has begun to take shape in just two weeks.

This article will adopt a historical development perspective to trace the formation of these documents, track the trajectory of thought, and understand the cognitive evolution from "point" to "line" to "plane."

---

## Chapter 1: 2026-01-05 — The Troika of Thought

### 1.1 What Happened on This Day?

January 5th, 2026, marks a significant starting point for this project. Three core INSIGHTs were produced on this day:

1. [Module-Level Human-AI Collaborative Software Engineering Architecture](czon://f14dd5dd9a733022055d249db9b1ed3d60d9b60b7eb8c063fe24c02774b6b631)
2. [How to Address Human Desire for Control — On the Controllable Trust Problem in Human-AI Collaboration](czon://3a40b7b252512466f0b0feb8c7ea77fc624bb0026cbae8882c5c205462e0aa64)
3. [Embracing "Limitations," Designing "Infinity" — A New Paradigm for Constructing Agent Systems Based on LLM Constraints](czon://038e3e093437a25f9eb22aabb4debaa185632c4e19a53b3103b614e016160b80)

These three articles form a complete ideological system, answering three questions:
- **What to do?** → Module-level human-AI collaborative architecture
- **Why do humans resist?** → Desire for control and controllable trust
- **What are the constraints?** → The three major structural constraints of LLMs

### 1.2 The Origin of Thought

From a historical perspective, the emergence of these three articles has deep-rooted reasons:

**Background One: The Dilemma of Vibe Coding**

Before the formal writing, CZ had already started using vibe-kanban for project management. He discovered a core contradiction: managing more tasks increased anxiety rather than reducing it.

**Background Two: Disappointment with AI Coding**

CZ attempted to use AI to generate code from scratch for the ZEN project, encountering severe engineering quality issues. This prompted him to think: Where are the boundaries of AI coding?

**Background Three: Reflection on "Control"**

As a person with a high desire for control, CZ began to reflect: Why can't I let go and let AI handle tasks? What is the root of this desire for control?

These three backgrounds converged on January 5th, producing three mutually reinforcing articles.

### 1.3 The Triangular Structure of Thought

These three articles form a stable triangular structure:

```
          Controllable Trust (2)
                 △
                 │
                 │
 Modular Collaboration ──┼── Theory of Limitations
 Architecture (1)        │
                 │
                 ▼
          Theory of Limitations (3)
```

- **Controllable Trust** answers the question "Why do humans resist AI autonomy?"
- **Modular Collaboration** answers the question "How to design human-AI collaboration?"
- **Theory of Limitations** answers the question "What are the fundamental constraints of LLMs?"

These three questions are independent yet mutually supportive, forming a complete theoretical framework for human-AI collaboration.

## Chapter 2: 2026-01-07 to 2026-01-10 — From Ideal to Reality

### 2.1 The Blow of Reality

On 2026-01-07, [LOGS/7.md](czon://ec3f1c3a8089db804d8c7ee8bb13516e629825954878d0592f731bba0ff78403) recorded a major setback: a significant failure in Vibe Coding, with AI-generated code quality being too poor, forcing a complete rewrite of the ZEN project.

This is an important temporal node—it marks the first major collision between theory and practice.

CZ summarized four reasons in this article:
1. AI's insufficient capability in designing object-oriented programming paradigms
2. AI's lack of clarity on whether it's producing one-off code or code for long-term maintenance
3. Lack of an AI-friendly scaffolding
4. AI being overly conservative in handling compatibility requirements

### 2.2 Adjustments in Practice

Faced with this setback, CZ made two important decisions:

**Decision One: Abandon OOP, Shift to Procedural/Functional Programming**

> Emphasize not using OOP, shifting to procedural and functional programming. This is a crucial shortcut that can significantly improve the quality and maintainability of AI-generated code.

**Decision Two: Introduce "Occam's Razor Principle"**

> Must make AI understand Occam's Razor principle: Do not multiply entities beyond necessity.

These two decisions mark a shift from "idealized assumptions about AI capabilities" to "pragmatic use of AI."

### 2.3 Evolution of Tools

This period was also critical for the development of CZON/ZEN tools:

| Date | Event |
|------|------|
| 2026-01-08 | Using vibe-kanban for project management |
| 2026-01-08 | ZEN rewrite completed, AI OOP issues discovered |
| 2026-01-08 | Decision to rename ZEN to CZON |
| 2026-01-09 | Implementation of AI-generated permanent link functionality |
| 2026-01-09 | Decision to use JSX for theme system implementation |

The renaming from ZEN to CZON is not just a name change but a clarification of the product's positioning.

---

## Chapter 3: 2026-01-10 to 2026-01-12 — Deepening of Content

### 3.1 Refinement of Content Philosophy

On 2026-01-10, [INSIGHTS/4.md](czon://b539b67214d42b1734da5fd166f90c8376bc7edb46a982a2a2deaf0c278da5bd) proposed a concise and powerful viewpoint:

> Create in depth, distribute in breadth.

This is a profound insight into the nature of content creation. Creation is deep (from observation to thought), distribution is broad (from author to reader).

This viewpoint was later interpreted in [LOGS/12.md](czon://4580b674791cf5faff672fb6a396e7446380d1ad78f4852d4b1748c6b36e2659) as CZON's "N-shaped curve."

### 3.2 The Beginning of Interdisciplinary Migration

On 2026-01-14, [INSIGHTS/5.md](czon://c1596c01c2aca5ab8ea5b18b579dd619b7da780327705352dc45e461535dd54e) completed the migration of Su Yu's military thought to multi-agent systems.

This is an important intellectual milestone—it marks the point where CZ's thinking began to break through a single domain and extend into broader knowledge spaces.

From a historical perspective, this interdisciplinary migration is not accidental:

1. **Knowledge Base**: CZ has an understanding and interest in military history.
2. **Problem-Driven**: Multi-agent collaboration problems require new solutions.
3. **Pattern Matching**: Su Yu's "enemy situation - determination - deployment - coordination" structure highly resembles the elements of multi-agent systems.

### 3.3 The Germination of Strategic Thinking

During this period, CZ began to think about more macro-level issues:

**Regarding Influence:**

[LOGS/14.md](czon://36df516cd093734ffb542992a016c1edec8528da3734d6573ef7bee0e49be75b) proposed an influence formula:
> The benefit of doing something = (Pricing - Cost) × Influence

**Regarding Paths to Earning Money:**

[LOGS/15.md](czon://243f24730d79d403e0b4e6bc2368ae67bfb83fdd54fbd47de54d11044638e325) listed three possible paths:
1. Asset management business in mature markets
2. Proprietary trading opportunities in emerging markets
3. Building a product with users

This marks the expansion of CZ's thinking from "technical problems" to "business problems."

## Chapter 4: 2026-01-14 to 2026-01-18 — Integration of the System

### 4.1 Proposal of Capital Protracted Warfare

On 2026-01-17, [INSIGHTS/6.md](czon://70f752f5d01a078a8ac562e9e99479420a74b1a20847683bd0e95ceec72e8851) (draft) proposed the concept of "Capital Protracted Warfare."

This is a systematic reflection on investment strategy, refuting three erroneous views:
- The Inevitable Defeat of Individuals
- The Steady Development Theory
- The All-In Get-Rich-Quick Theory

Interestingly, this investment theory echoes the earlier human-AI collaboration theory:

| Human-AI Collaboration | Investment Strategy |
|---------|---------|
| Controllable Trust | Risk Control |
| Modular Decomposition | Capital Management |
| Arbitration Mechanism | Stop-Loss Mechanism |

Both embody the thinking mode of "seeking optimal solutions within constraints."

### 4.2 Establishment of the CZON Brand

On 2026-01-12, [LOGS/12.md](czon://4580b674791cf5faff672fb6a396e7446380d1ad78f4852d4b1748c6b36e2659) provided a complete interpretation of CZON as C-Z-O-N:

- **C** - Content Oriented
- **Z** - Zero Configuration
- **O** - Organic AI-Native
- **N** - N-shaped Energy Curve

This marks a shift from "building a tool" to "building a brand."

### 4.3 Deepening of Self-Awareness

On 2026-01-18, [LOGS/17.md](czon://8e7c951081dc02ce9f591815abdeabcc735fe4523ecb555621d9649da805cac0) recorded an interesting attempt: using AI to summarize his own documents and experimenting with different tones and styles.

CZ discovered:
- Objective and neutral tone: Basically usable.
- Sarcastic tone: Too sarcastic, ignoring facts.
- Sycophantic tone: Too sycophantic, ignoring facts.
- After adding the prompt "pay attention to facts": The critical version and literary version worked well.

More importantly, the AI's MBTI analysis showed INTJ, which differed from CZ's previous test result of ENTP.

CZ's interpretation was: "The writer's inherent sample set tends towards introspective self-reflection, with some natural bias inherent."

This is a profound self-awareness—recognizing one's potential blind spots.

## Chapter 5: Timeline of Ideological Evolution

### 5.1 Chronological Emergence of Core Concepts

Organizing the first appearance of core concepts chronologically:

```
2026-01-05  ──┬─ Module-Level Human-AI Collaborative Architecture
              ├─ Controllable Trust Theory
              └─ Theory of Limitations (Three Major Constraints)

2026-01-07  ── AI Coding Limitations (OOP issues, backward compatibility issues)

2026-01-10  ── Create in depth, distribute in breadth

2026-01-14  ── Su Yu Framework Migration

2026-01-16  ── Influence Formula

2026-01-17  ── Capital Protracted Warfare
```

### 5.2 Trajectory of Thematic Evolution

Several clear thematic evolutions can be seen from the timeline:

**Phase One: Technical Issues (2026-01-05 to 2026-01-07)**
- Focus: How to make AI work better.
- Main Outputs: Architecture design, theoretical frameworks.

**Phase Two: Product Issues (2026-01-07 to 2026-01-14)**
- Focus: How to build a better product.
- Main Outputs: Technical decisions, feature planning.

**Phase Three: Strategic Issues (2026-01-14 to present)**
- Focus: How to position oneself in the larger game.
- Main Outputs: Investment strategies, influence considerations.

This thematic evolution from technology to product to strategy reflects a progressive layering of thought.

### 5.3 The Iteration Between Theory and Practice

Another interesting pattern is the iteration between theory and practice:

| Date | Event | Type |
|------|------|------|
| 2026-01-05 | Three INSIGHTs produced | Theory |
| 2026-01-07 | AI coding failure | Practice |
| 2026-01-07 | Summary of OOP issues | Theoretical reflection |
| 2026-01-10 | CZON JSX refactoring | Practice |
| 2026-01-10 | AI auto-classification planning | Theory |
| 2026-01-12 | C1 feedback | Practice |
| 2026-01-14 | Su Yu framework | Theoretical innovation |
| 2026-01-17 | Capital protracted warfare | Theoretical innovation |

This iterative pattern indicates that theory does not arise in a vacuum; it stems from practice. Practice is not blind; it requires theoretical guidance.

## Chapter 6: Development of Interpersonal Relationships

### 6.1 Within the Team

Interactions with team members can be traced from the documents:

**C1 (Thrimbda):**
- 2026-01-08: Discussed CZON development direction.
- 2026-01-09: Discussed custom theme functionality.
- 2026-01-15: Discussed CZON feature feedback.
- 2026-01-15: Discussed LegionMind improvements.
- 2026-01-16: Discussed paths to earning money.

**Ryan, Mage:**
- Mainly mentioned in the context of the EA project ([QUANT/EA/EA.md](czon://7c014cb9b38c396e838ccbd9ef58886775ba91e876f4db498a9c838a0e345729)).

**Professor Xi Chen:**
- One of the initiators of the EA project, tenured professor at NYU.

### 6.2 External Communication

**Hobo:**
- 2026-01-11: Lunch discussion on LLM coding and observability issues.
- Proposed the "Elite Capability Theory," forming a dialogue with CZ's "Constructivism."

**Brother Ji:**
- 2026-01-17: Shared market cases of the "plow back all paper profits" strategy.

### 6.3 Changes in Communication Patterns

From the timeline, early communication leaned more towards technical issues, gradually expanding to business and investment issues later. This likely reflects:
- The project transitioning from a technical exploration phase to a commercialization phase.
- CZ's focus expanding from "how to do" to "what to do" and "why to do it."

## Chapter 7: Response to External Events

### 7.1 DeepSeek Engram Paper

On 2026-01-13, [LOGS/13.md](czon://941c1a4338289c31a189cedf3dd7a8e861ffdf43db4dedbde90143076092b866) recorded the response to the DeepSeek Engram paper:

> Today was another early day, waking up around 7 AM. Upon waking, I found DeepSeek had published a new paper... The core idea of the paper is introducing a new memory mechanism...

CZ shared a summary of the paper on his social feed, sparking discussion.

This was a practice of the "chasing trends" strategy and part of influence building.

### 7.2 Institutional Roadshow

On 2026-01-16, [LOGS/15.md](czon://243f24730d79d403e0b4e6bc2368ae67bfb83fdd54fbd47de54d11044638e325) recorded the experience of an institutional roadshow:

> Yesterday's schedule was packed, starting with a roadshow to institutions about our strategy and product, which received some recognition.

This marks the EA project's transition from theoretical design to actual fundraising.

### 7.3 Re-reading "On Protracted War"

On 2026-01-16, [LOGS/16.md](czon://f0cf35bc13450cc8cc48bcbcfa2b5d35f442c0d06907890b28267c10d3cca82a) recorded re-reading "On Protracted War":

> Yesterday, I re-read "On Protracted War" because I was planning an article on "plowing back paper profits is the only way for capital management" and wanted to find historical examples to support the viewpoint...

This method of drawing inspiration from historical wisdom is consistent with the migration of the Su Yu framework.

---

## Chapter 8: Continuity and Discontinuity of Thought

### 8.1 Continuity

Throughout all documents, some persistent themes can be identified:

**Theme One: Seeking Optimality Within Constraints**
- From the three major constraints of LLMs to the three erroneous views on investment.
- Core idea: Finding optimal solutions under limiting conditions.

**Theme Two: Systematic Thinking**
- From module-level architecture to multi-agent frameworks.
- Core idea: Decomposing problems into manageable modules.

**Theme Three: Long-Termism**
- From the "protracted warfare" of human-AI collaboration to the "protracted warfare" of capital.
- Core idea: Time is the best friend.

**Theme Four: Interdisciplinary Migration**
- From military command to AI systems.
- From political-military to investment strategy.
- Core idea: The transferability of deep patterns.

### 8.2 Discontinuity and Adjustment

There are also some inconsistencies:

**Viewpoint One: Regarding Influence**

Early on ([LOGS/1.md](czon://5f5bbaa342d85760e742d4e4d97d9be6843d8e0fa3540ea25969b4e3e43488aa)) mentioned "tools at the company and team level," while later ([LOGS/17.md](czon://8e7c951081dc02ce9f591815abdeabcc735fe4523ecb555621d9649da805cac0)) realized "the Markdown + GitHub format is not very suitable for mass communication."

**Viewpoint Two: Regarding AI Coding**

In [INSIGHTS/1.md](czon://f14dd5dd9a733022055d249db9b1ed3d60d9b60b7eb8c063fe24c02774b6b631), a relatively optimistic attitude towards AI coding was held (ensuring quality through testing and benchmarks), but after the major failure in [LOGS/7.md](czon://ec3f1c3a8089db804d8c7ee8bb13516e629825954878d0592f731bba0ff78403), the attitude towards AI coding became more cautious.

These "discontinuities" are not contradictions but iterations and deepening of cognition.

---

## Chapter 9: Historical Portents of the Future

### 9.1 Assessment of the Current Stage

From a historical development perspective, the project is currently in:

**The transition phase from technical exploration to commercialization.**

Characteristics:
- Core technical frameworks have taken initial shape (CZON, EA, FSA).
- Beginning to focus on influence building and commercial monetization.
- Expanding from "what to do" to "how to do it" and "who will do it."

### 9.2 Possible Future Directions

Based on the historical trajectory, some speculations can be made:

**Direction One: Specialized Deep Dive**

May focus deeply on a specific field (quantitative trading), with other areas serving as supplements.

**Direction Two: Platform-Based Expansion**

May develop CZON into a content platform, with EA as an entry point for quantitative services, creating synergistic effects.

**Direction Three: Influence Monetization**

May monetize accumulated technical expertise and cognitive advantages through content output, training, consulting, etc.

### 9.3 Risks to Be Wary Of

From a historical perspective, there are several potential risks:

**Risk One: Attention Fragmentation**

The multi-project parallel mode may lead to resource dispersion, requiring clear prioritization.

**Risk Two: Over-Theorization**

The theoretical framework is already quite rich, requiring more practical verification and implementation.

**Risk Three: Timing Window**

Currently in a dual-window period for AI applications and cryptocurrency. How to seize this window is a question that needs consideration.

---

## Conclusion: Growing from Time

Two weeks, 25 documents, five main projects (CZON, EA, FSA, LegionMind, influence building).

This is not an endpoint, but a starting point.

From the three INSIGHTs on 2026-01-05 to the LOGS on 01-18, we have witnessed the growth process of an ideological system. It has an origin, development, adjustments, and deepening.

More importantly, we have seen how a person, through continuous writing and thinking, connects scattered knowledge points into lines, lines into planes, and planes into a cohesive whole.

Time is the best filter, retaining what is most valuable.

These documents, whether for CZ himself or for future readers, will be a valuable asset.

Because they record: at a specific point in time, how a person thought, acted, and grew.

"title": "Reflections on CZON Development and CZONE Product Planning"
"summary": "This article records the author's reflections on the CZON development process on February 4, 2026. The author mentions the frustrations GB encountered while setting up CZON, including HTTP proxy issues, API switching, and GitHub Pages configuration. These issues revealed insufficient consideration for edge cases in the product design. The author decided to adjust the strategy: let users start with the more simplified CZONE first, and then switch to CZON when they have a need for self-managed data. The goal of CZONE is to provide a smooth experience similar to posting on social media, enabling users to go from writing from scratch to publishing a website without any obstacles. The author thanks GB for the valuable feedback and promotion, seeing it as a crucial starting point for product improvement, and is determined not to let down the enthusiasm of early users."

It's now February 4, 2026, 2:00 PM.

I recall that setting up CZON for GB yesterday encountered some setbacks again. We first struggled with the HTTP proxy, then went through an explanation of the OPENAI Compatible concept, switching from Gemini to OpenAI and then to DeepSeek. Finally, we got stuck on the GitHub Pages configuration. After twists and turns, we finally got GB up and running.

However, this is not a good thing; it doesn't align with my aesthetic for simplicity. GB is actually part of my ideal user group, yet I couldn't make his usage process smooth sailing. This is a warning sign, indicating that I didn't consider enough edge cases when designing CZON.

But there's no helping it. I should have let him use CZONE first, and then switched him to CZON when he has a need to manage his own data. However, the initial development of CZONE failed last time. Now, with the unlimited power of Opus, it can be re-implemented.

CZONE should guide users as smoothly as possible through the entire process from starting from scratch, writing something, to publishing it on the internet. Users should not feel any obstacles during this process. Pick up the phone, open CZONE, write something, publish it to a website. It should be as simple as posting on social media.

Nevertheless, I am still grateful for GB's feedback; it's very valuable user experience data. Moreover, GB actively promoted CZON to his colleagues. Although I understand this stemmed from personal connections rather than the product's inherent appeal, it's still a good start. A product that doesn't seem appealing in concept wouldn't be actively promoted by others.

Keep going. Don't let down the enthusiasm of these early users.

The journal focuses on the discussion sparked in their social circle by a summary of the DeepSeek Engram paper shared the previous day, emphasizing the importance of following trends and producing valuable content to attract attention. Using the NTNL team as an example, the author notes that past projects lacked due attention because of insufficient promotion and states a future focus on publicity. The article delves into the long-term process of building influence, comparing it to a crucial multiplier in the personal brand and收益 formula. It specifically contrasts the role of influence in quantitative trading versus public-facing projects, ultimately concluding that individuals with greater influence can create a virtuous cycle, gaining more resources and opportunities."

It is the morning of January 14, 2026.

Another day of super early rising, waking up just after 5 a.m. I fell asleep very early last night, around 9 p.m. It was probably because my body needed rest after several days of intense work.
Although my sleep schedule is extremely irregular, I almost always maintain 8-9 hours of sleep.

After waking up early, I handled some emails and messages, then started writing this journal.

Yesterday, I worked on a summary of DeepSeek's Engram paper and simply posted a news commentary on my social feed, which sparked some discussion. It seems people are quite interested in large language models.
I didn't really produce any new insights myself; I just summarized the paper's content. I incorporated some of my own understanding and added my perspective.

This is essentially the benefit of following trends. As long as you can promptly engage with trending topics and produce some valuable content, you can attract attention. If you can gradually build your influence, you'll have more opportunities in the future.

Our NTNL team has worked on many excellent projects in the past, but because team members tend to be low-key and lacked promotion, many projects didn't receive the attention they deserved.
In the future, we will pay more attention to publicity and promotion, so more people can learn about our projects and achievements.

I hope there will be more opportunities in the future to share our ideas and experiences with everyone.

Influence is a long-term process of accumulation. It requires consistently producing valuable content and actively participating in community interactions.

Ultimately, it manifests in a person's personal brand, helping them gain more opportunities and resources in the future.

This is an independent multiplier in the final outcome we can achieve, playing a very important role.

Simply put, the收益 from doing something = (Price - Cost) x Influence. If influence remains only a single-digit figure, then no matter how high the price is, the final收益 won't be very large.

When doing quantitative trading, the factor of influence is often overlooked. The thinking is that as long as the strategy is good and makes money, that's enough. Because you only need to pitch to a few major clients to secure large funds.
But when working on a project, especially one面向大众, influence becomes very important. Greater influence attracts more funding and users, leading to higher final收益.

However, different paths lead to the same destination. People with greater influence often have better resources and opportunities to work on better projects, creating a virtuous cycle.

It is the morning of January 14, 2026.

Another day of super early rising, awake just after 5 a.m. I fell asleep very early last night, around 9 p.m. It's probably because my body needed rest after several days of intense work.
Although my sleep schedule is extremely irregular, I almost always maintain 8-9 hours of sleep.

After waking up early, I handled some emails and messages, then started writing this journal.

Yesterday, I worked on a summary of DeepSeek's Engram paper and briefly posted a news commentary on my social feed, which sparked some discussion. It seems people are quite interested in large language models.
I didn't really produce any new insights myself; I just summarized the paper's content. I combined it with my own understanding and added some of my perspectives.

This is essentially the benefit of following trends. As long as you can promptly engage with trending topics and produce some valuable content, you can attract attention. If you can gradually build your influence, you'll have more opportunities in the future.

Our NTNL team has worked on many excellent projects in the past, but because team members tend to be low-key and lacked promotion, many projects didn't receive the attention they deserved.
In the future, we will pay more attention to publicity and promotion, so more people can learn about our projects and achievements.

I hope there will be more opportunities in the future to share our ideas and experiences with everyone.

Influence is a long-term process of accumulation, requiring the continuous production of valuable content and active participation in community interactions.

Ultimately, it manifests in a person's personal brand, helping them gain more opportunities and resources in the future.

This is an independent multiplier that significantly impacts the final scale of results we can achieve.

Simply put, the return from doing something = (Price - Cost) x Influence. If influence remains only a single-digit figure, then no matter how high the price, the final return won't be substantial.

In quantitative trading, the factor of influence is often overlooked; the focus is on having a good strategy to make money. Because you only need to pitch to a few major clients to secure large funds.
But for a project, especially one aimed at the general public, influence becomes very important. Greater influence attracts more funding and users, leading to higher final returns.

However, different paths lead to the same destination. People with greater influence often have better resources and opportunities to undertake better projects, creating a virtuous cycle.

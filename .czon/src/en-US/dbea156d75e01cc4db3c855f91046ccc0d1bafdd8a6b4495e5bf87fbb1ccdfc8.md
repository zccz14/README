"summary": "This article proposes the concept of building an AI-Native content engine, with the core principle being 'deep creation, shallow distribution.' Content creation is a deepening process from superficial observation to deep thinking, while distribution is the process of conveying that thinking to the audience in a shallow manner, avoiding information overload. Technologies like SEO and recommendation algorithms serve the purpose of efficient information delivery, which is the first principle of content creation and distribution. In the past, this relied on human creativity, but now AI is changing the landscape."

# From Creation to Distribution—Building an AI-Native Content Engine

It can be summarized in one sentence: **Deep creation, shallow distribution.**

Content originates from thought, and thought originates from observation. The process of content creation is a continuous deepening from superficial observation (perception) to deep thinking (cognition).  
The process of content distribution, on the other hand, involves conveying this thinking to the audience, prompting them to engage in new observation and thought. At this stage, it is essential to master shallow distribution—avoiding information overload and enabling the audience to easily access and understand the content.

Any technology, including SEO and recommendation algorithms, serves the purpose of efficient information delivery. When this is done well, the data will naturally reflect it. This can be considered the first principle of content creation and distribution.

In the past, content creation and distribution primarily relied on human creativity and labor.

Now, AI has arrived.

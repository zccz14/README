# From Creation to Distribution: Building an AI-Native Content Engine

In summary, it boils down to one sentence: **Create with depth, distribute with simplicity**.

Content originates from thought, and thought originates from observation. The process of content creation is a continuous deepening journey from surface-level observation (perception) to deep thinking (cognition).  
The process of content distribution, on the other hand, involves conveying this thinking to the audience, prompting them to engage in new observations and reflections. At this stage, it is essential to master the art of simplified distribution, avoiding information overload and enabling the audience to access and understand the content effortlessly.

All technologies, including SEO and recommendation algorithms, serve the purpose of efficient information transmission. When this is done well, the data will naturally reflect it. This can be considered the first principle of content creation and distribution.

In the past, content creation and distribution relied primarily on human creativity and labor.

Now, AI has arrived.

"summary": "This paper proposes Full-Spectrum Analysis (FSA), an investment and trading strategy framework optimized based on the Kelly Criterion. The article first analyzes the limitations of the traditional Kelly formula in investment applications, such as the lack of consideration for leverage and short selling, liquidation timing issues, etc. FSA then constructs a systematic trading decision model by defining an outcome space, calculating optimal leverage, and compound yield. The paper elaborates on the mathematical principles of FSA, including the calculation of expected yield and compound yield, as well as the algorithm for solving optimal leverage using Newton's method. Additionally, it introduces historical backtesting methods (such as Gross Profit Margin calculation), considerations for live trading modules, and measures to handle black swan events. The core advantage of FSA lies in its ability to utilize imperfect probability information to maximize long-term returns by optimizing leverage decisions, thereby reducing the high requirement for information quality."

# Full-Spectrum Analysis: The Optimal Method for Monetizing Information

2025-08-10

## Background

**How to maximize the growth rate of assets?**

In 1956, J.L. Kelly published "A New Interpretation of Information Rate." The paper discussed how a gambler could use known information to maximize the compound growth rate of their assets. It proposed a probabilistic method to guide betting strategies. However, applying this paper to actual investment activities presents several issues:

1.  It does not utilize borrowing leverage or short selling, keeping its conclusions within the 0~1 practical leverage range.
2.  It assumes the gambler bets on a specific event symbol, receiving a payout if it occurs next, otherwise losing the bet. But traders can only bet long/short, and the corresponding bullish/bearish events yield different results and different returns across various time windows.
3.  Liquidation timing: Kelly assumes the end of the gamble is not determined by the gambler's will. However, traders can decide to exit or continue holding at any time.
4.  Redundant Bayesian methods assume event development depends on prior and conditional probabilities. Removing Bayesian methods does not affect the derived mathematical essence. It increases complexity, making direct application of the paper's formulas difficult; practical use requires simplification.

We will follow the probabilistic method from Kelly's paper to explore a practical strategy applicable to the investment and trading domain.

## Full-Spectrum Analysis: Full-Spectrum Analysis, FSA

### Outcome Space, Optimal Leverage, and Optimal Yield

Assume implementing a certain trading strategy will result in several different outcome events. Let the outcome space be $X$. $X$ is non-empty (in practical scenarios, at least 2 outcomes exist).

Make some additional assumptions:

1.  Deterministic Return: Each outcome event corresponds to a definite yield. Let the yield for outcome $i$ be $R_i$.
    1.  ✅ Events with different yields should be considered different outcome events, e.g., a 1% profit and a 2% profit are different.
    2.  ❌ Grouping profit events with significantly different yields into the same outcome violates deterministic return.
2.  Deterministic Probability: Let the probability of outcome $i \in X$ occurring be $P_i$, ($0 \le P_i \le 1$).
    1.  ✅ The probability of each outcome needs to be assessed deterministically.
    2.  ❌ Stating that an outcome has an "over 80% chance": 80%～ 100%, violates deterministic probability.
3.  Mutual Exclusivity: It is impossible for two outcomes to occur simultaneously.
    1.  ✅ Design outcome events that are completely impossible to occur simultaneously.
    2.  ❌ If outcome events have intersections, e.g., "hold for 20 minutes" and "drop 20%" could occur together, violating mutual exclusivity.
4.  Completeness: The sum of probabilities for all outcomes is 100%. No outcomes exist outside the predefined set, i.e., $\sum_{i \in X} P_i = 1$.
    1.  ✅ Consider all possible outcomes that could occur.
    2.  ❌ If outcome events only define "rise over 20%" and "drop over 20%", without defining "fluctuation between -20% and 20%", it violates completeness.
5.  Leverage Effect: Yield follows the leverage effect. If using $k$ times leverage, when outcome $i$ occurs, the yield is $k \cdot R_i$, meaning assets become $1 + k \cdot R_i$ times the original.
    1.  ✅ Investment products with sufficient liquidity conform to this characteristic.
    2.  ❌ When the position size becomes too large, market impact costs due to liquidity cause returns to no longer follow a linear relationship.

For the outcome space $X$, we can calculate its **Expected Earning Yield**:
$$E(X) = \sum_{i \in X} P_i R_i$$

The concept of expected yield is intuitive and convenient to calculate. The problems with expected yield are:

1.  It leads to extreme decisions—either zero position or full position—failing to control bankruptcy risk. If the expected yield is positive, it tends to infinitely amplify leverage to seek higher returns, even if high leverage can lead to ruin.
2.  It does not consider the compounding effect. It only considers the return of a single investment, not that the market allows repeated investments. This does not align with actual investment management.

**Compound Earning Yield** refers to the average yield per trade after repeating multiple independent trades:

$$C(X, k) = (\prod_{i \in X} (1 + k \cdot R_i)^{P_i}) - 1$$

**Optimal Earning Yield** is the maximum value of the compound yield across different leverages:

$$O(X) = \max_k C(X, k)$$

To avoid ruin (zeroing out), it must satisfy $1 + k \cdot R_i >0$ for all outcomes, leading to a basic feasible region $K$ for k:

Upper bound:

$$\max k = \max(0, \min_{R_i < 0} {-\frac{1}{R_i}})$$

Lower bound:

$$\min k = \min(0, \max_{R_i > 0} {-\frac{1}{R_i}})$$

And an always feasible solution $k = 0$,

$$K = (\min k, \max k) \cup \{ 0 \}$$

The optimal leverage is the $k$ within the feasible region $K$ that maximizes the compound yield $C(X, k)$.

$$k_o = \argmax_k C(X, k)$$

At any moment, the actual leverage in the account can be calculated: $k = \frac{\text{Position Size}}{\text{Account Equity}}$, and the optimal leverage $k_o$ can be evaluated.
All trading strategies ultimately correspond to an actual leverage. Making a deterministic trading decision is equivalent to deciding the value of $k$. The optimal leverage corresponds to the ideal position.

Thus, we obtain a trading framework:

1.  Design the outcome space $X$.
2.  Continuously evaluate the probabilities $P$ of different outcomes.
3.  Calculate the actual leverage $k$ and the optimal leverage $k_O$.
4.  Control the actual leverage to approach the optimal leverage.

> **Special Points**
>
> The trivial point $C(X, 0) = 0$, meaning "no participation, no profit or loss."
> When we have no position, it's equivalent to deciding $k = 0$. For any instrument, whether holding a position or not, we are making a decision at every moment.
> Short selling corresponds to the case $k < 0$; if $|k| > 1$, it means additional leverage is required.

### Solving the Optimization

Recalling the problem: given outcome space $X$, probability distribution $P_i$, yield $E_i$, feasible region $[L, R]$, find the leverage rate $k \in [L, R]$ that maximizes the yield:

Rearranging the compound yield and taking the logarithm on both sides (preserving monotonicity), we get:

$$\ln (1 + C(X, k)) = \sum_{i \in X} P_i \ln (1 + k \cdot R_i)$$

Let

$$G(k) = \ln(1 + C(X, k)) = \sum_{i \in X} P_i \ln (1 + k R_i)$$

According to the definition of optimal leverage:

$$k_o = \argmax_k C(X, k)$$

Since $f(x) = \ln(1+x)$ is monotonically increasing:

$$k_o = \argmax_k C(X, k) = \argmax_k G(k)$$

Taking the first and second derivatives of $G(k)$:

$$G'(k) = \sum_{i \in X} \frac{P_i R_i}{1 + k R_i} $$

$$G''(k) = \sum\_{i \in X} -\frac{P_i R_i^2}{(1 + k R_i)^2} $$

Each term in the second derivative is non-positive, so $G''(k) \le 0$. If and only if $P_i R_i \equiv 0$, then $G''(k) = 0$, but in this case, $G(k) \equiv 0$, yielding no profit and having no practical significance. In other cases, $G''(k) < 0$. This means $G(k)$ is a strictly concave function, and $G'(k)$ is strictly monotonically decreasing. $G(k)$ has one and only one maximum point, which is also the global maximum point.

As shown in the figure below, regardless of the number of terms, the $G(k)$ curve is concave.

![Kelly Criterion - Curve Illustration](czon://2422dc9f38d7d5aec3288d100b4334dfdbc7adfd4eba88814511a78ad3a0a4ce)

The maximum point of $G(k)$ is the zero of its first derivative:

$$G'(k) = \sum_{i \in X} \frac{P_i R_i}{1 + k R_i} = 0$$

Rearranging this equation transforms it into a polynomial equation in k.
If there are $N$ distinct values of $R_i$, the highest degree of the polynomial is $N-1$.
According to the Abel–Ruffini theorem, polynomials of degree five and higher have no general algebraic solution formula.

The common Kelly formula is the special case where $N=2$: Let win probability be $p$, and odds be $b$.

| Outcome | Probability | Yield |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Win     | $p$         | $b$   |
| Loss    | $1-p$       | $-1$  |

Substituting yields the equation:

$$G'(k) = \frac{pb}{1+kb} + \frac{-(1-p)}{1 -k} = 0$$

Simplifying gives:

$$k = \frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}$$

Thus proving the Kelly formula.

For trading scenarios, there might be countless outcomes with different yields; therefore, only numerical solutions are feasible.

As a strictly concave function of a single variable, using Newton's method is the optimal choice.
Starting the iteration from the fixed point $$G(0) = 0$$ is a good option; for a strictly concave function, iteration from any starting point converges to the same result.

#### Newton's Method Exceeding the Feasible Region

A potential issue is that the iteration point from Newton's method might fall outside the problem's feasible region.
A minimal example illustrates this situation:

$$p_1 = 0.9, r_1 = 0.5, p_2 = 0.1, r_2 = -1$$

Yields

$$G(k) = 0.9 \times \ln(1+0.5k) + 0.1 \times \ln(1 - k)$$

![G(k) Function Graph](czon://4068dbc6a1d3a0c0f375de7413f335115d4124fa2a01a5646010c56d8ec767ad)

Calculation shows the feasible region $K = (-2, 1)$, with an analytical optimal leverage $k_o = 0.7$.
However, using Newton's method, the first iteration point is:

$$G(0) - \frac{G'(0)}{G''(0)} = \frac{14}{13} > 1$$

![G‘(k) and Newton's Method Demonstration](czon://e5c9fbcc6e652381ce552a033b04583b026e01af0369b5b3bba1e18f4d50fbd3)

The first iteration point exceeds the feasible region, moving outside the domain where the derivative is defined, making further iteration meaningless. This shows the naive Newton's method itself cannot handle cases where the iteration point leaves the feasible region.

The solution is: after calculating the iteration point using Newton's method, an additional check is needed to see if it lies within the feasible region. If it does, iterate to that point. If not, based on its direction, take a point between the feasible region boundary and the current point as the next iteration point.

#### Algorithm Pseudocode

Algorithm $\text{resolve}(G, L, R, \epsilon = 10^{-9}, N = 100, \alpha = 0.9)$

1.  Initialize $k \gets 0$
2.  Calculate the basic feasible region $K$ based on return rates $r_i$
3.  Clip the feasible region: $L \gets \max(L, \min K), R \gets \min(R, \max K)$
4.  Loop for a maximum of $N$ iterations:
    1.  Calculate the next point: $k' \gets k - \frac{G'(k)}{G''(k)}$
    2.  If $k'$ is not in $K$:
        1.  If $k' \ge R$, set $k' \gets \alpha R + (1-\alpha)k$
        2.  If $k' \le L$, set $k' \gets \alpha L + (1 - \alpha) k$
    3.  If the difference is less than the precision threshold $| k' - k | < \epsilon$, break the loop.
    4.  Update $k \gets k'$
5.  Return $k$

#### Code Implementation

From a programming perspective, a more suitable abstraction is to let each outcome in the set have two attributes: return rate r and weight w. This outcome space can be traversed, and the algorithm can be written as:

```ts
/**

    if (next_k <= lower) {
      next_k = lower * alpha + k * (1 - alpha);
    } else if (next_k >= upper) {
      next_k = upper * alpha + k * (1 - alpha);
    }

    k = next_k;
  }

  const lne =

  const e = Math.exp(lne) - 1;

  return { k, e, it, sum_w, lne, upper, lower };
}
```

### Other Mathematical Properties

#### When the Feasible Region is Unbounded, a Positive Expected Yield Implies a Positive Optimal Yield

Proof:
Since $f(x) = \ln(1+x)$ has the same sign as $x$, the signs of $C(X, k)$ and $G(k)$ are the same.
Consider the derivative of $G(k)$ at $k = 0$: $G'(0) = \sum_{i \in

"title": "Exploring AI Tone Rewriting Features and Productization Considerations"
"summary": "On January 18, 2026, while using Claude Code to summarize documents, the author tested various tones such as objective/neutral, harsh, and sycophantic, discovering that the AI's tone rewriting feature tended to overlook factual accuracy. After adding prompts to emphasize factual attention, the generated critical, artistic/emotional, and personality analysis versions of the summaries all yielded excellent results. Particularly, the personality analysis version inferred the author as an INTJ type based on the writing content, providing insightful observations. The author believes that sticking to the facts is a crucial principle, and AI should not sacrifice factual accuracy to cater to a specific tone. Based on this exploration, the author considered opportunities for productizing the AI summarization feature, analyzing challenges such as market demand, dissemination formats, and costs, and plans to first create a prototype to test market response."

It is the morning of 2026-01-18.

I woke up a bit after 8 AM today, maintaining a normal routine. After getting up, I used Claude Code to summarize all my documents.

It defaulted to an objective and neutral tone, which I thought was quite good, allowing exploration of the entire repository's content.

Afterwards, I asked it to try summarizing using a harsh tone. The result was indeed too harsh—a kind of harshness that ignored facts, a harshness for the sake of being harsh, completely failing to meet my requirements.

Then, I asked it to try summarizing using a sycophantic tone. The result was indeed too sycophantic—a kind of sycophancy that ignored facts, a sycophancy for the sake of being sycophantic, completely failing to meet my requirements.

In short, I identified its problem: its tone rewriting feature **essentially disregards factual accuracy**.

I believe it likely wasn't aware of this issue, hence the results. So, I added some prompts, instructing it to pay attention to facts, and tried again.

This time, it generated a critical version of the summary, and the result was unexpectedly good. I felt like I was receiving critique and guidance from a senior colleague—there was both praise and criticism, well-reasoned and evidence-based, which felt excellent. It pointed out my shortcomings while also affirming my strengths, making it acceptable because these were indeed indisputable facts.

Then, I asked it to generate an artistic/emotional version of the summary, which also turned out very well. I felt like I was being celebrated by a bard—there was imagery, emotion, and感染力, which felt excellent. It depicted my efforts and achievements, allowing me to feel my own value, to feel seen, heard, and understood.

Finally, I generated a personality analysis version of the summary, which was also very good. I felt like I was being analyzed by a psychologist—there was depth, insight, and启发, which felt excellent. It revealed my motivations and behaviors, helping me understand my inner self. It identified me as an INTJ type, which I found interesting because my previous test results indicated ENTP. However, its data source was based on what I wrote, so I found its analysis more convincing. This is because I rarely reveal the personal, lived-in side of myself in my writing. And writers, by nature, tend to have a sample set leaning towards introversion and self-reflection, introducing some inherent bias.

Sticking to the facts is a commendable practice, and AI should also learn to stick to the facts, not ignore them to cater to a specific tone.

If this were to be developed into a product, it would likely be highly shareable and could easily become a hit. Especially for year-end summaries—everyone likes to summarize but is often too lazy to do it themselves, or feels their own summaries aren't objective enough. Currently, there's no such product on the market, presenting a good opportunity.

However, in terms of dissemination, the current CZON Markdown + GitHub format isn't very suitable for mass appeal, as most people aren't familiar with it and might even struggle to register a GitHub account. So, if productizing, we might need to consider a more accessible format, like a web app or mobile app. The product would also need an interactive UI, possibly prioritizing a mobile-first editing experience (to be confirmed). Additionally, we must consider AI costs, as generating AI content is still relatively expensive. Options include a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model where users provide their own API keys to reduce operational costs, or a subscription fee to cover expenses. Initially, to attract users, we might need to offer a free trial quota.

This isn't my main focus, but it's still a worthwhile opportunity to dip a toe in. Perhaps I can start with a simple prototype to gauge market response. If feedback is positive, further development and promotion can be considered.

Overall, today's收获 was quite significant—I feel like I've learned a lot.

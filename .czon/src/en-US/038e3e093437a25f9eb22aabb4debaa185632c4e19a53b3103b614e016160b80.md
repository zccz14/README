# Embracing the "Finite," Designing the "Infinite" – A New Paradigm for Constructing Agent Systems Based on LLM Constraints

2026-01-05

### **Abstract**

Based on a profound analysis of the inherent limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), this article proposes a new paradigm for constructing powerful agent systems. The current pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) often falls into the myth of an "omnipotent" model, overlooking its inherent structural constraints: **non-mandatory coordination**, **finite computational budget**, and **cognitive incompressibility**. This article argues that instead of futilely attempting to eliminate these limitations, we should acknowledge and embrace their "finiteness." Through sophisticated systems engineering, we can transform the constraints themselves into design principles, thereby achieving "infinite" scalability at a higher level. The core pathways are: externalizing internal contradictions into explicit processes through **Coordination Engineering**, optimizing allocation under resource scarcity via **AI Decision Economics**, and transforming static knowledge compression into dynamic information adaptation through **Cognitive Flow Management**. This "Finite Agent, Infinite System" paradigm directly confronts the **"Münchhausen Trilemma"** in intelligent system design—the fundamental conflict between the infinity of thought itself and the finiteness of thinking resources—and provides a practical theoretical framework and guide for building reliable, scalable, and evolvable human-AI collaborative systems.

### **1. Problem Context: From the "Omnipotence Myth" to "Finiteness Awakening"**

Generative Artificial Intelligence, represented by Large Language Models, has achieved breakthrough progress, sparking boundless imagination about AGI. However, when attempting to apply LLMs to solve complex real-world tasks, their performance often falls far short of the "omnipotent" expectation. Agents struggle to complete coherent, reliable, multi-step work in one go, exposing the fundamental limitations of current LLMs as cognitive cores. At their essence, these limitations are not temporary technical flaws but structural constraints rooted in their architecture, resources, and cognitive paradigm.

This reflects a profound philosophical and engineering dilemma: the manifestation of the **Münchhausen Trilemma** in the field of AI. We expect agents to engage in infinitely deep thinking to obtain perfect solutions, but their thinking process must consume finite, expensive computational resources. This fundamental contradiction between infinite desire and finite resources cannot be eliminated. Continuing down the single path of "creating more omnipotent models" will not only encounter significant economic and computational bottlenecks but may also sow hidden dangers for system safety and controllability. Therefore, we must undergo a fundamental "paradigm shift": from futilely pursuing an "infinitely intelligent individual" to prudently **designing an "infinite system capable of integrating and orchestrating finite intelligence."**

### **2. Core Thesis and Arguments**

#### **2.1 Thesis One: Taming "Non-Mandatory Coordination" with "Coordination Engineering"**

The "non-mandatory coordination" characteristic of LLMs refers to their inability to guarantee that the generation process simultaneously satisfies all given, even conflicting, constraints. This is not an error but an inevitable consequence of their probabilistic generation nature and the engineering compromise of "must output" to avoid "thinking halts." Forcing a single LLM to perform complex coordination of multiple objectives and constraints in a single inference is akin to asking one person to simultaneously play the roles of project manager, architect, developer, and tester; the result is often a compromise or mediocre output.

**Solution and Pathway**: We neither need nor can change this underlying characteristic of LLMs. Instead, we should use **Coordination Engineering** to shift the burden of coordination from inside the model to outside the system. This manifests as three progressively advanced architectural patterns:

- **Checklist Pattern (Posterior Coordination)**: Suitable for scenarios with clear constraints and minimal conflict. After the LLM generates a draft, the system validates it against an explicit checklist and guides the LLM for targeted revisions, transforming "one-time satisfaction" into an iterative loop of "generate-validate-correct."
- **Parliamentary Debate Pattern (Explicit Coordination)**: This is the core solution for handling multi-dimensional conflicting concerns. The system instantiates a dedicated Agent role for each core concern (e.g., feasibility, safety, user experience), forming an "expert parliament." A neutral "Chairperson" Agent organizes debates and negotiations, externalizing originally implicit internal trade-offs into open, transparent, and auditable clashes of viewpoints and comprehensive resolutions.
- **Constraint Solver Pattern (Formalized Coordination)**: For highly structured, mathematically expressible problems (e.g., scheduling, resource allocation), the LLM is positioned as a "requirement perceiver," responsible for translating natural language requirements into formal constraints. These are then handed over to traditional constraint solvers or optimization algorithms for computation. Finally, the LLM translates the formal results back into natural language.

The core idea of these engineering methods is: **Elevating "coordination" from an implicit struggle within the LLM to an explicit, structured process at the system level**, thereby achieving overall coordination reliability through architecture while acknowledging the finiteness of individual units.

#### **2.2 Thesis Two: Responding to the "Münchhausen Trilemma" and "Finite Computational Budget" with "AI Decision Economics"**

Commercial LLMs always operate under a finite computational budget, which is the direct economic manifestation of the **Münchhausen Trilemma**: the desire for infinite thought is bound by finite "thinking fuel" (computation). A "smarter" model typically implies higher inference costs. Expecting a cost-agnostic "omnipotent AGI" to solve all problems is neither economical nor realistic. Therefore, the system must possess the ability to make rational decisions within a finite budget: that is, allocating precious computational resources to the thought processes most likely to generate high value.

**Solution and Pathway**: This requires us to introduce the mindset of **AI Decision Economics**, treating computational power, time, and API costs as scarce resources, and establishing market-based or quasi-market-based mechanisms for optimal allocation. Its implementation can be divided into four levels:

- **Base Currency Layer**: Establish measurable cost units, such as token consumption, inference time, and API fees, attaching clear "price tags" to all computational operations.
- **Value Assessment and Budget Layer**: Define a task's "value function" (static or dynamic) and allocate budgets accordingly. An advanced form could introduce an internal "auction market," allowing high-value, urgent tasks to "bid" for more computational resources. This is a mechanized answer to the fundamental question: "Which thoughts are worth consuming resources for?"
- **Decision Strategy Layer**: Empower each Agent with economic rationality, such as adopting a "fast thinking, slow thinking" strategy (first generating a low-cost answer quickly, then applying for budget for deep thinking if confidence is low), or deciding whether to call expensive external tools based on expected value.
- **Market Coordination Layer**: At the macro level, a distributed task market and resource market can be constructed. Agents act as free economic agents, allowing resources to automatically flow to the individuals who can utilize them most efficiently through bidding and trading, achieving Pareto optimization of system-wide resources.

The essence of this framework is **confronting the "Münchhausen Trilemma" head-on**, not fantasizing about infinite resources, but by constructing a controlled internal economic system, externalizing and mechanizing the resource allocation optimization problem. This endows the system with an endogenous drive to pursue "thinking cost-effectiveness," seeking optimal solutions within finiteness.

#### **2.3 Thesis Three: Accepting "Cognitive Incompressibility" with "Cognitive Flow Management"**

"Cognitive incompressibility" posits that there is a theoretical lower limit to the amount of information required to fully understand a specific problem; it cannot be infinitely compressed through a "magic instruction." The general pre-training of LLMs cannot cover all the tacit knowledge, project context, and dynamic changes of specific domains. Attempts to solve all problems with one perfect prompt are doomed to fail. This also represents the shattering of the fantasy of "infinitely compressing cognition."

**Solution and Pathway**: We should abandon the fantasy of "compressing cognition" and shift towards **managing cognitive flow**. That is, designing a system capable of efficiently diagnosing cognitive gaps, acquiring information on demand, and dynamically constructing and updating its understanding of the current task. Its practical implementation manifests as a series of layered strategies:

- **From "Indoctrination" to "Navigation"**: The system no longer attempts to receive all information at once. Instead, like a "tour guide," it guides users to provide necessary information step-by-step or offers clear options at key decision points, managing the progressive process of cognition.
- **Progressive Cognitive Loading**: Drawing on the concept of "progressive disclosure," information is presented on-demand and in layers. The conversation starts with high-level goals and gradually delves into specific details, avoiding initial information overload and respecting the objective pace of cognition.
- **Iterative Alignment Loop**: Accepting the imperfection of initial understanding, establish a rapid iteration mechanism of "draft-feedback-refinement." The system treats preliminary output as the starting point for aligning cognition, not the final deliverable, thereby distributing the pressure of one-time cognitive transfer across multiple low-cost alignment cycles.
- **Environmental Awareness and Learning**: The system should actively analyze codebases, documentation history, and interaction logs to extract project-specific "tacit knowledge," and continuously learn from feedback to achieve cognitive evolution, allowing the cognitive flow to continuously enrich and deepen over time.

The core of this paradigm is **viewing human-AI collaboration as a dynamic process of co-weaving a cognitive network**, managing the rate, sequence, and density of information flow to adapt to incompressible cognitive needs, rather than engaging in futile compression.

### **3. Conclusion and Future Research Outlook**

This article argues that the key to building powerful AI systems lies in philosophically accepting the reality of LLMs as "finite intelligence units" and directly confronting the fundamental contradiction revealed by the **"Münchhausen Trilemma"**. The trinity framework we propose—**Coordination Engineering, AI Decision Economics, and Cognitive Flow Management**—does not attempt to eliminate finiteness. Instead, through system design, it transforms constraints into rules that drive evolution, thereby achieving "infinite" capability expansion at a higher level. This marks a fundamental shift: from the magical thinking of praying for an "omnipotent oracle" to the engineering mindset of building a "well-defined, resource-efficient, learning-capable" intelligent society.

Looking ahead, this paradigm of "embracing the finite, designing the infinite" opens up a series of exciting research directions:

1.  **Multi-Agent Social Mechanism Design**: How to design more efficient, fair, stable, and ethically aligned collaboration, negotiation, and governance mechanisms for Agent societies? How to prevent malicious behaviors like collusion and fraud in games?
2.  **Endogenous Value and Alignment**: In controlled economic or game environments, how to guide AI to evolve beneficial and human-aligned values through interaction? How to design "constitutional" meta-rules to constrain value drift and ensure it does not deviate from the track of human well-being?
3.  **Quantification and Optimization of Cognitive Flow**: How to move beyond qualitative descriptions to establish formal models for precisely measuring cognitive gaps, information entropy, and cognitive flow efficiency? Can a universal descriptive language and optimization algorithms for cognitive flow management be established?
4.  **New Interfaces for Human-AI Fusion**: In cognitive flow management, how to design more natural and efficient human-AI interaction interfaces, enabling humans to coordinate and guide the cognitive processes of multiple agents as intuitively and elegantly as conducting a symphony orchestra?
5.  **Exploring the Limits of "Finiteness"**: What is the theoretical upper limit of overall agent system performance under given architectural and resource constraints? How can we continuously approach this limit through architectural innovation?

Ultimately, we may find that the dawn of strong artificial intelligence does not come from a solitary super-brain trying to break free from the "Münchhausen Trilemma," but from countless agents that calmly accept their own finiteness, performing a harmonious symphony together on a meticulously designed "infinite" stage that stimulates the emergence of collective wisdom. This is precisely the humble yet powerful intelligent future that "Embracing the Finite, Designing the Infinite" points towards.

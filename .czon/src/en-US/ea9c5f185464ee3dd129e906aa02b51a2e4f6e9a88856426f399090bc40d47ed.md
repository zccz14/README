# README

Hello, this is `CZ`, or `zccz14`.

My professional expertise lies in quantitative trading and fintech.

Founder of [No Trade No Life (NTNL)](https://github.com/No-Trade-No-Life/).

I have a high-energy-consuming brain, enjoy thinking and writing, and pursue things that follow naturally and logically.

"If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die in the evening." Although I'm not ready to die yet and am still pursuing worldly success, it's to gain the ability to experience more and thus understand more. Life is all about experience; it inherently has no meaning, and understanding everything is my purpose.

This site serves as a place to store some of my personal thoughts, records, and insights.

If one day I'm no longer here, these will be the raw materials for an AI to resurrect me.

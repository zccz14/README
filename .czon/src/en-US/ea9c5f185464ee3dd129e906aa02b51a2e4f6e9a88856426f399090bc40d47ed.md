# README

Hello, this is `CZ`, or `zccz14`.

My professional focus is on quantitative trading and fintech.

Founder of [No Trade No Life (NTNL)](https://github.com/No-Trade-No-Life/).

A high-energy-consumption brain, I enjoy thinking and writing, pursuing what feels natural and inevitable.

"If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die content in the evening." Although I don't wish to die yet and am still pursuing success in the worldly sense—this too is to gain the ability to experience more and thus understand more. Life is all about experience; it inherently has no meaning. Understanding everything is my meaning.

This site is a place to store some personal thoughts, records, and insights.

If one day I am no longer here, these will be the raw materials for an AI to resurrect me.

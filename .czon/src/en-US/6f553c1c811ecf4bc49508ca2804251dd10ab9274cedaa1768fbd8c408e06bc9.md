# The Protracted War of Capital (Draft)

2026-01-17

As individual investors, our purpose in surviving and thriving in the market is to achieve sustained wealth growth, ultimately aiming for class mobility. We often yearn to discover a method for stable profitability to achieve success, or we fantasize about seizing an opportunity to get rich overnight. However, both avenues are often difficult to realize. The former is challenging because market competition is fierce, and strategies can never guarantee long-term victory. The latter is fraught with high risk and often requires a massive bet. There are many voices promoting erroneous views, such as the "Inevitable Defeat Theory" that claims individuals can never beat the market and investing is destined to lose money, the "Steady Development Theory" that insists wealth accumulation must rely on time, and the "All-In Get-Rich-Quick Theory" that advocates gambling for a chance to turn a bicycle into a motorcycle. You will always see people who get rich overnight in the market, and you will also see many who go bankrupt. Consequently, many people simplistically attribute the outcome to either a matter of capability or luck.

I wish to propose a new perspective on the survival and development strategy for individual investors in the market. **I believe that waging a protracted war is the only viable path for individual investors to achieve class mobility.** Superficially, the term "protracted war" doesn't sound like a strategy welcomed by individual investors. It seems to suggest advising people to endure, sacrifice, disregard short-term gains and losses, and incur significant time costs—something quite contrary to human nature. It demands that one toils diligently day after day for years, enduring the market's multifaceted assaults.

To solidify this stance, clarify its essence, and distinguish it from other viewpoints, I will refute three common misconceptions in the market one by one:

### **Refuting the Inevitable Defeat Theory**

Many believe that individual investors can never beat the market and are destined to lose money.

Their reasoning generally boils down to four points:

1.  Individuals' limited information is at a disadvantage compared to the market's complete information.
2.  Individuals' limited capital is at a disadvantage compared to the market's infinite capital.
3.  Individuals' limited knowledge is at a disadvantage compared to professional teams or institutions.
4.  The market contains fixed "rake" mechanisms, such as transaction fees and taxes, which erode profit margins.

This view overlooks the learning capacity and adaptability of individual investors. The market is a game-theoretic system where "cutting" and "being cut" are dynamically changing and symbiotic ecological relationships. If the "being cut" side disappears, the "cutting" side loses its foundation for existence. Moreover, this ecology forms a cycle, creating a dynamic equilibrium in a triangular game. Often, choosing one's ecological niche is key to an individual investor's success, not whether one can gain an absolute advantage. Proponents of the Inevitable Defeat Theory view the market too narrowly, ignoring its complexity and dynamism. **This is a typical mindset of rejecting an entire entity upon seeing a flaw.**

Proponents of this view often also believe that the ultimate winners are always large institutions and professional teams. However, professional teams also started as individual investors. They grew into professional teams through continuous learning and adaptation to the market. Institutions and individuals differ merely in form, scale, resources, and stage of development, not in essence. Individual investors can absolutely, through a protracted war, gradually accumulate experience and capital, ultimately achieving the goal of class mobility.

There is also a subtle variation of this view, which posits that a winner-takes-all scenario might eventually emerge, where individual investors can never survive in the market and will be entirely eliminated. If this were truly the case, the "harvesters" would lose their foundation for existence, and the market ecology could not be sustained. Therefore, this viewpoint is also untenable.

Furthermore, this is a cynical perspective, attempting to evade the market's realities by denying the capabilities of individual investors. Can individual investors truly avoid being "cut" by not participating in this market? This is merely an ostrich mentality. The economy has long engulfed everyone. In today's world, most currencies are pegged to the US dollar, whose value is closely tied to US Treasury bonds, which in turn fund US development. Many people accumulate wealth but dare not invest in the market, only to find their wealth constantly eroded by inflation, ultimately becoming the "cut" side. In the future, even if the US falters, another country will take up the baton and continue issuing a global reserve currency. This is unavoidable because the essence of wealth is control over resources. Wealth that cannot be exchanged for resources from others is ultimately illusory.

**While individual investors may be at a disadvantage in some aspects, they also possess unique advantages, such as independence, adaptability, flexibility, and liquidity.**

*   **Independence:** Allows individual investors to focus solely on their own investment strategies and goals without needing to compromise with anyone else. Institutions often must consider the interests of shareholders, clients, and other stakeholders, complicating decision-making.
*   **Adaptability:** Individual investors can at least choose not to participate in certain markets and can choose to learn and adapt to market changes, free from many constraints. Institutions often need to maintain established business models, making rapid adjustments difficult.
*   **Flexibility:** Enables individual investors to quickly adjust strategies to adapt to market changes without going through cumbersome approval processes. Institutions often require multi-layered approvals, leading to slow responses.
*   **Liquidity:** Individual investors can enter and exit markets almost without restriction, choosing different investment instruments and markets. Institutions are often constrained by capital size and regulatory requirements.

If individual investors can fully leverage these advantages and continuously learn and adapt to the market, they are entirely capable of achieving success in the market.

### **Refuting the Steady Development Theory**

There are many theories in the market teaching people how to achieve steady wealth growth, how to avoid risks, and how to earn a 10-30% annual return. If this were possible, by the time assets multiply tenfold, a decade would have passed, life would have moved into its next stage, and as daily life stabilizes, the significance of wealth growth diminishes. This strategy demands endurance and the cost of time, **yet it fails to address the fundamental contradiction in personal wealth growth—the conflict between the finite nature of an individual's lifespan and the time required to accumulate wealth.** An individual's lifespan is limited, while wealth growth requires time to accumulate; there is an inherent conflict between the two. If an individual relies solely on a steady development strategy for wealth growth, it is likely that exponential wealth growth will not be achieved before the end of their lifespan. Moreover, if wealth does not arrive when it is most needed, what significant meaning does pursuing wealth hold in old age?

Some may fantasize about achieving wealth growth for future generations through inheritance, using this as their own purpose. However, the saying "a son selling his father's land feels no heartache" reflects the unreality of this notion. Each generation has its own struggles and lifestyle. Future generations may not cherish the wealth accumulated by their predecessors and might even squander it. Therefore, leaving wealth to the next generation is not necessarily meaningful. Inheritance is meaningful only when both wealth and ideology are passed down. In fact, the transmission of ideology is more crucial; it is the primary element.

Refuting the Steady Development Theory may sound unorthodox, but for individual investors, this perspective is a pragmatic choice. Individual investors need to soberly recognize that the time available for wealth growth is limited, and steady development strategies often cannot achieve exponential wealth growth within that limited timeframe. Therefore, individual investors need to find a strategy capable of achieving wealth growth in a relatively short period, not rely solely on steady development. **I am primarily refuting viewpoints that advocate steady development under any and all circumstances.**

Of course, contradictions can transform—when personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development strategies become more important. At that point, wealth is sufficient to support personal living needs, and steady development strategies can help maintain stable wealth growth, avoiding losses due to market volatility. Furthermore, as a base for the next round of wealth growth, a steady development strategy can provide a "base area," preparing for another campaign for class mobility.

However, before personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development is not the optimal choice for individual investors seeking wealth growth. Individual investors need to find a strategy capable of achieving wealth growth in a relatively short period.

### **Refuting the All-In Get-Rich-Quick Theory**

On the other hand, a minority in the market advocate the "bet it all to turn a bicycle into a motorcycle" strategy, believing that a single high-risk investment can achieve rapid wealth growth. This strategy seems to solve the time problem of personal wealth growth but actually overlooks the importance of risk management. Those who hold and act on this view are either novices uninitiated by the market or desperate gamblers with little left to lose. They often believe their luck can overcome market risks, but reality is often different.

All-in investments are typically accompanied by enormous risks. Failure can lead to severe personal wealth loss or even bankruptcy. Moreover, market opportunities are not available to everyone, and the probability of success is often very low. Therefore, relying solely on an all-in investment strategy cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. Currently, in the MEME market, there are many myths of overnight riches, with stories of thousand-fold or ten-thousand-fold gains abound, attracting hordes of speculators. However, these stories often ignore the underlying risks and failures, leading many speculators chasing the dream of quick riches to ultimately end up bankrupt.

Some people appear to go all-in, but in reality, the capital they risk each time is not their entire wealth but all the capital they have on the "gambling table." Even if they lose, they have reserves. These individuals are not the proponents of the All-In Get-Rich-Quick Theory we are discussing. However, under certain conditions, such individuals can also become true all-in investors—for example, when the capital on their "table" approaches their total wealth. Those accustomed to all-in investing are increasingly likely to eventually become true all-in investors.

Comparatively, most people understand this principle. But when opportunities arise, they are often too quickly overwhelmed by the desire for quick riches, transforming into all-in investors. This is the most common mistake individual investors make during the future strategic stalemate phase. It is necessary to build psychological fortitude in advance to prevent losing rationality and making wrong decisions when opportunities present themselves.

This is both a crisis and an opportunity. **The more people advocate all-in get-rich-quick schemes, the more it indicates the presence of significant volatility and immense opportunity in the market. The more enthusiastic people are about gambling, the more they can perceive the existence of high-volatility markets.** Individual investors need to soberly recognize that all-in investment strategies cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. However, if one can moderately utilize all-in strategies under controlled risk, individual investors are entirely capable of achieving rapid wealth growth in the market.

## The Protracted War of Capital

The protracted war I refer to does not imply a war of attrition in the temporal sense, but rather achieving exponential wealth growth through a publicly verifiable strategy. It consists of several components:

1.  Learn to correctly analyze the contradictions and situation between ourselves and the "enemy" (the market/other participants) to formulate the correct strategic direction.
2.  Prepare a stable source of cash flow input to ensure survival from a position of weakness.
3.  Learn to maintain and accumulate advantages, avoiding pointless time consumption from monitoring screens, thereby achieving continuous expansion of advantages.
4.  Learn to press the advantage at the right moment, pursue decisive victory, and not miss historical opportunity windows.

It sounds complex, but the practical implementation is simple.

1.  **A cash flow input must be prepared.** Use time cost to exchange for information and experience advantages. There must be a controllable, recurring cash flow that can be continuously invested. This can be salary income or stable interest income. This cash flow doesn't need to be large, but it must be stable. With this cash flow, one can continuously make small investments in the market, accumulating information and experience advantages.
2.  **Programmatic trading methods must be used** for underlying investment operations to avoid any emotional decision-making and prevent discipline issues during the execution phase. Furthermore, programmatic trading saves the individual investor's energy and reduces psychological pressure from regretting exiting a position to "break even." The goal is not a fully automated system but an imperfect yet profitable system that saves mental effort. **The investor must focus their energy on designing and optimizing programmatic strategies**, not on staring at screens or agonizing over every buy/sell decision. This is the key to what I call advantage accumulation and avoiding pointless consumption.
3.  **Scale into profitable positions.** When capital is deployed in the correct direction, profits will quickly appear. Utilize a scaling-in strategy based on floating profits to continuously expand the advantage. Note: There is a very strict stop-loss condition here: if losses reach the level before scaling in, a stop-loss must be executed. This is because market volatility clusters; tailwinds and headwinds often come in clusters. If one can seize the opportunity during a cluster of tailwinds, the scaling-in strategy can be used to continuously expand the advantage.

This process ultimately has two outcomes: either successfully achieving exponential wealth growth, or failing with limited losses.
Regardless of the outcome, the individual investor can accept it calmly, learn from it, and grow.

**Difference from "Identify an Opportunity and Bet Heavily"**

The difference from "identify an opportunity and bet heavily" is that it does not require identifying an opportunity. Instead, it allows the market to automatically filter out the correct opportunities—those that can sustain and expand profits. When the market reverses, the stop-loss is set at the loss level before scaling in, thereby controlling losses within a manageable range.

**Is it possible to lose perpetually?**

Yes. This is because the strategy itself fails to process market conditions into opportunities that are profitable for a sufficiently long duration. For example, if this strategy can achieve a 16-win streak, it means the strategy can find enough clusters of tailwind opportunities in the market to achieve exponential wealth growth. If the strategy can only achieve a 4-win streak, it may not achieve exponential growth.

However, even in perpetual loss, losses are within a controllable range. Individual investors can continuously adjust and optimize the strategy, eventually finding one capable of achieving exponential wealth growth. Moreover, there might be a market cycle perfectly suited for this strategy, allowing it to achieve enough consecutive wins for exponential growth.

**When can victory be declared?**

Victory for a local strategy can be declared when the current market liquidity is insufficient to support large-scale capital deployment. At this point, the individual investor can choose to realize profits or transfer capital to other markets in search of new opportunities. If exponential wealth growth has already been achieved, the investor can choose to exit the market and enjoy the fruits of their labor.

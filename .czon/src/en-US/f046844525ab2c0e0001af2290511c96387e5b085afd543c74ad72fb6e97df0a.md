"title": "CZON JSX Refactoring and AI Classification Feature Planning"
"summary": "This article first reviews the completed work on the CZON project, including refactoring the original placeholder-replacement-based template engine to use the React ecosystem's JSX for page rendering, and temporarily shelving the custom theme feature to focus on improving core functionality. Next, the article focuses on planning the implementation of the AI classification feature: generating a classification system by having AI read the meta.json content, then automatically tagging each article with a classification label, with requirements such as no more than 10 categories, at least 3 articles per category, and each article belonging to only one category. This feature must be completed after extracting metadata for individual articles but before enhancing Markdown metadata to handle potential translation needs. Finally, the article looks ahead to the application value of classification tags in categorized browsing and recommendation systems."

It is the morning of January 10, 2026.

The JSX rendering refactoring for CZON has been preliminarily completed. Following the ideas outlined in [this document](czon://c1f75326e1864105c4c33c72e3c6d2fd1e9331ffe60f0600595770e84f22763d), CZON can now render different types of pages using JSX components. The original placeholder-replacement-based, AI-crafted template engine has been removed and replaced with JSX from the React ecosystem for page rendering. However, the custom theme feature has been temporarily shelved to focus on improving core functionality.

As the text content gradually becomes richer, it seems about time to start building the AI classification feature, which is one of CZON's core selling points. I don't want to manually classify the content, especially as the volume grows, which would become cumbersome. Therefore, I plan to let AI assist with this task.

In short, I intend to have AI first read all the content in meta.json, then generate a classification system based on that content, and finally have AI tag each article with a classification label according to this system. This will enable automatic classification.

Clearly, this stage must occur after metadata extraction for individual articles but before the Markdown metadata enhancement phase. This is because it may generate classification labels that require translation, so it must be completed before generating the .zen/src native language Markdown files.

When AI performs classification, it's best not to generate too many categories, as that would make things cluttered. Each category should contain at least 3 articles; otherwise, the categories would be too fragmented. This is similar to the principle that code should be extracted into a component only after being repeated three or more times.

Additionally, the number of categories should be limited, preferably to no more than 10. Too many categories would overwhelm users when browsing the classification directory, hindering content discovery rather than helping it.

Of course, each article should belong to only one category, not multiple, to ensure clarity and simplicity in classification.

Once classification tags are in place, features like categorized browsing and recommendation systems can be implemented later. Users will be able to browse related content based on classification tags, and the recommendation system can prioritize articles from the same category, thereby enhancing the user reading experience.

Time to get to work—let's go!

It is now January 9, 2026, early morning.

I have just renamed ZEN to CZON. Implemented the AI-generated permanent link feature and removed the previous SHA-256 hash-based URL scheme. Also added logic for the 404.html page to redirect to the homepage.

In a previous discussion with Thrimbda, I was debating the implementation approach for custom themes—whether to use a traditional templating language like Handlebars or to implement them directly using JSX components. Handlebars (and similar products like EJS, Jinja, etc.) fall into the category of traditional templating languages. Their advantages are simplicity and ease of use, but they have limited functionality, poor extensibility, and a lower ceiling. Using JSX components to implement custom themes, on the other hand, allows us to fully leverage the advantages of the React ecosystem, offering greater flexibility, extensibility, and a higher ceiling, albeit with a steeper learning curve.

But these days, with AI generating code directly, what's the point of learning a templating language? It seems meaningless. You only need to look at the code when debugging.

If we use JSX components for implementation, where should the folder containing the JSX components be placed? It seems it can only be under the .czon directory, for example, in the .czon/themes directory. This way, users can directly create their own theme components in the `.czon/themes/{theme-name}` directory.

I believe my technology choices lean towards the trendy direction. After all, ZEN/CZON primarily targets individual users and small teams, who are more inclined to use modern technology stacks to build and manage their knowledge bases.

So, it's decided—JSX it is! Once themes are implemented with JSX, we can simply call `renderToString` directly in the CZON CLI.

The next question arises immediately: how should the data layer be designed? How will themes access the framework's data? How will themes be managed, published, and installed?

Many issues remain to be resolved, but I feel the direction is becoming clearer. We'll make adjustments as we go.

"title": "The Capital Protracted War"
"summary": "This article critiques three mainstream investment perspectives: the 'Individual Inevitable Defeat Theory', the 'All-In Get-Rich-Quick Theory', and the 'Steady Development Theory', arguing that they fail to address the problem of individual investors crossing social classes. The author proposes the 'Capital Protracted War' framework, whose core idea is 'use losses you can afford to bear to bet on gains you cannot afford to miss'. This framework achieves opportunity capture under controlled risk by setting a maximum loss rate (C), floating profit (P(t)), and a trading threshold (L). It emphasizes waiting 90% of the time and executing 10% of the time, utilizing programmatic trading to avoid emotional decisions, and scaling into winning positions to amplify gains. The ultimate goal is to achieve leapfrog wealth growth, while failure results in limited losses that do not impact one's livelihood."

# The Capital Protracted War

Modified on 2026-01-20.

## Core Idea

**Use losses you can afford to bear to bet on gains you cannot afford to miss.**

This is not about stable profits, nor is it about all-in bets for sudden wealth. It is the optimal solution for the risk-reward ratio.

Three mainstream viewpoints exist in the market, but none of them solve the problem of individual investors crossing social classes:

1.  **Individual Inevitable Defeat Theory** - Believing one is destined to be exploited, thus avoiding the market.
2.  **All-In Get-Rich-Quick Theory** - Wanting to decide everything in one bet, leading to uncontrolled risk.
3.  **Steady Development Theory** - Wanting to get rich slowly, but lacking sufficient time.

This article proposes a fourth approach: **Use the smallest acceptable risk to pursue potentially massive, victory-defining gains.**

## Why the Three Viewpoints Are Wrong

### Refuting the Individual Inevitable Defeat Theory

Individual investors are at a disadvantage in terms of information, capital, and knowledge. Coupled with transaction costs eroding profits, defeat seems inevitable.

However, this view overlooks several facts:

*   The market is a dynamic game system where exploiters and the exploited coexist symbiotically. If the exploited disappear, the exploiters lose their foundation.
*   Professional teams also started as individuals. The difference between institutions and individuals lies in form, scale, and stage of development, not in essence.
*   Individual investors have a unique political cost advantage: independence. They don't need to coordinate multiple interests and can adjust strategies quickly.

A deeper issue: Can staying away from the market avoid being exploited? The modern world is already "interlinked by iron chains"—currencies are pegged to the US dollar, the dollar is anchored to US debt, and the global economy is deeply intertwined. Accumulating wealth while staying away from the market ultimately leads to being exploited by inflation.

**The essence of wealth is control over resources. Wealth that cannot be traded is illusory.**

### Refuting the All-In Get-Rich-Quick Theory

Going all-in seems to solve the time problem quickly, but it ignores risk management.

The essence of going all-in is: **Use losses you cannot afford to bear to bet on gains you cannot afford to miss.**

Once you fail, it's not just starting over from scratch; it's losing everything and going into debt.

Overnight thousand-fold stories in the MEME market attract many speculators, but these stories ignore the countless failures behind them. Most people end up bankrupt.

**The real crisis**: When opportunities arise, most people are blinded by the desire for sudden wealth and transform into all-in investors. This is the most common mistake during the strategic stalemate phase.

But this is also an opportunity. The more people go all-in, the greater the market volatility and the more opportunities arise. The key is not to avoid high-volatility markets, but to participate in a controlled manner.

### Refuting the Steady Development Theory

"Be a friend of time," "the magic of compound interest"—these golden phrases sound reasonable but ignore **the fundamental contradiction between the finite nature of an individual's lifespan and the time required to accumulate wealth**.

Warren Buffett's 20% annualized strategy suits institutions, not individuals seeking to cross social classes. It takes a decade for assets to increase tenfold, by which time one's life has already entered the next stage.

The dilemmas faced by individuals:

*   Steadily growing wealth cannot keep up with annually increasing living expenses.
*   Accumulation is constantly interrupted by unemployment, illness, or family emergencies.
*   Social pressures urge buying houses, cars, getting married, and having children.
*   The desire to take a big bet is tempered by the fear of losing existing savings.

Steady strategies are suitable as a "base area" *after* crossing the class barrier, but they are not the optimal choice *before* achieving that leap.

## The Capital Protracted War Framework

**The Capital Protracted War is not a war of attrition in the temporal sense, but rather using quantifiable, controlled losses to exchange for uncertain but potentially enormous gains.**

The framework is quantitative and immutable; the S-strategy is qualitative and requires personal accumulation and iteration. The two are separate.

### The Three Elements of the Framework

*   **$C$**: Maximum loss rate (the amount of loss one can bear per day/month)
*   **$P(t)$**: Floating profit above the risk control line, which grows linearly over time.
*   **$L$**: Floating profit threshold that triggers a trade.

### Operational Logic

1.  Set **$C$** and establish the risk control line **$F(t) \ge -C \cdot (t - T_0)$**.
2.  When not trading, **$P(t)$** grows linearly over time.
3.  When **$P(t) \ge L$**, use the entire **$P(t)$** as principal to execute strategy **$S$**.
4.  If profitable, scale into the position to amplify gains. If losing, stop loss and wait for the next cycle.
5.  Repeat until **$F(T_W) \ge A$** (victory condition) or **$F(t)$** hits bottom.

### Core Insight

**Money itself doesn't need to be traded. If it's lost, just wait; P(t) will increase on its own. The S-strategy is merely a tool for screening opportunities, not a means for stable profits.**

This is not about trading daily to accumulate small wins. This is about waiting for a major opportunity that comes once every few years and betting the entire accumulated P(t) on it.

**In the trading profession, 90% of the time is spent waiting, and 10% is spent executing.**

---

## Mathematical Interpretation

Let the victory condition be wealth **$A$**. Strategy **$S$** is a black-box function:

$$y = S(x, t_0, t_1)$$

Input capital **$x$**, output capital **$y$**, domain **$L \le x \le U$**.

### Risk Control Line

$$F(t) \ge - C \cdot (t - T_0)$$

**$C$** is the maximum loss rate you can bear. For example, investing 3000 yuan per month implies **$C = 100$** yuan/day.

### Definition of Floating Profit

$$P(t) = F(t) - C \cdot (t - T_0)$$

**Key Conclusion**: Even without any investment action, **$P(t)$** grows linearly over time. The risk control line is descending; the capital curve can remain flat, but the gap widens.

### Trading Action

When **$P(t) \ge L$**, the entire **$P(t)$** can be invested:

$$F(t_1) = F(t_0) - P(t_0) + S(P(t_0), t_0, t_1)$$

### Expected Return

Measure the expected time **$T_S(A, C)$** required for strategy **$S$** to achieve **$A$**.

If **$A = 10 million$** yuan, **$C = 100$** yuan/day, and historically it's achieved once a year on average:
*   Annual cost = 36,500 yuan
*   Annual gain = 10 million yuan

This is a worthwhile investment. But if it only happens once every 10 years, the risk is significant.

**You need to assess: Can you accept this expected timeframe?**

## Operational Rules

### Rule One: Prepare Cash Flow Input

Use time cost to gain an advantage. The cash flow doesn't need to be large, but it must be stable.

This is not "investing 6000 yuan every month," but rather "having 6000 yuan every month to cover potential losses."

### Rule Two: Programmatic Trading

Avoid emotional decisions. Focus energy on designing and optimizing the S-strategy.

Don't pursue a perfect strategy; pursue an imperfect but worry-free system.

### Rule Three: Scale In Immediately on Profits

If losses reach the pre-scaling-in level, you must stop loss.

The essence of scaling into winning positions is: Seize opportunities where momentum gathers to expand your advantage. After the cost basis rises, a safety buffer forms between the cost line and the net value line. When this buffer shrinks, it should trigger position reduction to prevent a margin call.

---

## Position Sizing Based on Loss

Position sizing based on loss = a primary school math word problem.

**Uncontrolled Investment Style**: Save for months and invest a lump sum, set no stop loss, hold on stubbornly when losing, and aggressively add to winning positions until stuck at the peak. This is "peak capital."

**Correct Investment Style**: Set a maximum daily loss amount. If reached, liquidate the position. Do not add more funds, do not try to catch the bottom. Wait for the next month to start fresh.

---

## Two Possible Outcomes

*   **Success**: Achieve leapfrog wealth growth and cross social classes.
*   **Failure**: Incur limited losses, merely meaning you worked for nothing, without impacting your livelihood.

Regardless of the outcome, you can accept it calmly and learn from it.

**Core Idea: I don't know what tomorrow will bring, but I know that no matter what tomorrow brings, I can bear it.**

---

## Summary

**Use losses you can afford to bear to bet on gains you cannot afford to miss.**

1.  **Control the Loss Rate**: Start with cash flow, set **C**, and achieve survival from a position of weakness.
2.  **Programmatic Trading**: Avoid emotional decision-making to achieve sustained expansion of advantages.
3.  **Scale into Winning Positions**: Press the advantage to achieve leapfrog growth. In case of failure, losses equal the pre-scaling-in amount and will not breach your cash flow.

**The framework is quantitative; the S-strategy is qualitative. The framework remains constant; the strategy can be changed. The core is using controllable losses to exchange for uncertain large gains.**

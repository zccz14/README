"title": "CZON JSX Refactoring and AI Classification Feature Planning"
"summary": "This article first summarizes the completed refactoring of the CZON project from a placeholder-replacement-based template engine to React JSX rendering. The original AI-crafted template engine has been removed, with a focus on improving core features, while custom theme functionality is temporarily postponed. It then details the implementation plan for the AI classification feature: generating a classification system by having AI read .meta.json content, assigning a single category label to each article, with each category containing at least 3 articles and the total number of categories not exceeding 10 to ensure clarity and simplicity. This feature must be completed after extracting metadata for individual articles but before enhancing Markdown metadata, to handle potential translation needs. Finally, it looks ahead to how category labels will support category browsing and recommendation features, enhancing the user experience."

It is the morning of January 10, 2026.

The JSX rendering refactoring for CZON has been preliminarily completed. Following the approach outlined in [this document](czon://c1f75326e1864105c4c33c72e3c6d2fd1e9331ffe60f0600595770e84f22763d), CZON can now render different types of pages using JSX components. The original placeholder-replacement-based, AI-crafted template engine has been removed and replaced with JSX from the React ecosystem for page rendering. However, the custom theme feature has been temporarily put on hold to focus on improving core functionality first.

As the text content gradually becomes richer, it seems about time to start building the AI classification feature, which is one of CZON's core selling points. I don't want to manually categorize the content, especially as the volume grows, which would become cumbersome. Therefore, I plan to let AI assist with this task.

In short, I intend to have AI first read all the content in `.czon/meta.json`, then generate a classification system based on that content, and finally have AI assign category labels to each article according to this system. This will enable automatic classification.

Clearly, this stage must occur after metadata extraction for individual articles but before the stage of enhancing Markdown metadata. This is because it may generate some category labels that require translation, so it needs to be completed before generating the `.czon/src` native language Markdown files.

When AI performs classification, it's best not to generate too many categories, as that could lead to clutter. Each category should contain at least 3 articles; otherwise, the categories would become too fragmented. This principle is similar to how code is recommended for extraction into a component only after being repeated more than 3 times.

Additionally, the number of categories should be limited, preferably not exceeding 10. Too many categories would overwhelm users when browsing the classification directory, hindering content discovery instead of helping it.

Of course, each article should belong to only one category, not multiple, to ensure clarity and simplicity in classification.

Once category labels are in place, features like category browsing and category recommendations can be implemented later. Users will be able to browse related content based on category labels, and the recommendation system can prioritize articles from the same category, thereby enhancing the user reading experience.

Time to get to work, let's go!

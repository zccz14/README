# Humorous Style Summary

This document is based on a systematic analysis of all Markdown files, using a witty touch to reconstruct the daily life of this creator with a "high-energy-consumption brain."

## 1. Character Portrait

### 1.1 Daily State

This individual named CZ—a programmer/trader/philosopher/product manager/writer—possesses an enviable yet pitiable trait: **his brain is always on fire**.

> "High-energy-consumption brain, enjoys thinking and writing"

Translated into plain language: **This person can't stay idle**.

Wakes up at 5 AM to read DeepSeek papers (yes, you read that right, papers, not short videos), gets so sleepy he has to go to bed before midnight (the health-conscious guru among programmers). Sleeps 8-9 hours a day, with a sleep schedule that is "extremely irregular"—but this isn't laziness, it's **a high-level player's adaptive sleep strategy**.

### 1.2 Self-Perception

His self-assessment is quite honest:
- "High-energy-consumption brain" → Brain won't stop, overthinks
- "Pursues things happening naturally and effortlessly" → Doesn't want to exert effort, wants to make money lying down
- "If I learn the truth in the morning, I can die content in the evening" → Sounds romantic, but it's essentially **anxiety** about missing any new knowledge

Even more impressive is this line:
> "If one day I'm gone, these will be the raw materials for AI to resurrect me."

Wow, this is **writing his own resurrection script in advance**. It seems he's not just a carbon-based life form writing documents, but also preparing a resurrection guide for silicon-based life.

### 1.3 Social Media Activity

This guy shared DeepSeek's Engram paper yesterday and posted about it on social media. And then?

> "It sparked some discussion. Seems people are quite interested in large language models."

I'm speechless.

You shared a paper and it sparked discussion—isn't that normal? Why does it sound like **discovering a new continent**?

Oh wait, he said:
> "I didn't really produce any new insights myself, just summarized the paper's content."

So his point is: **I casually shared something, and everyone got excited**.

Alright then, I don't understand the world of the big shots.

## 2. Project Shenanigans

### 2.1 The Naming Metaphysics of CZON

The project was initially called ZEN. Later renamed to CZON. Why?

> "The name ZEN has been overused"

Wow, too many projects on GitHub are named ZEN, so he chose a more niche name: **CZON**.

The explanation is quite cultured:
- C = Content Oriented
- Z = Zero Configuration
- O = Organic AI-Native
- N = N-shaped Content Creation and Distribution Energy Curve

He even wrote a poem specifically for the last N:

> A spark of inspiration begins to sprout,
> Tempered a hundred times, its aura grows stout.
> To spread across the seas, it briefly bows low,
> Yet borrows the echo to soar high and go.

All I can say is: **The blood of a literary youth flows in the veins of an engineering guy**.

### 2.2 The Magical Reality of Renaming

On the early morning of January 9, 2026, this guy made a major decision:
- Renamed ZEN to CZON
- Implemented AI-generated permanent links
- Deleted the previous SHA-256 hash link URL scheme

Did all this in one night—**how many times speed were you running at**?

And he even attached an image in the document:

![妙啊](妙啊.png)

Caption: **妙啊！真是无巧不成书！** (Wonderful! What a coincidence!)

What can I say? Just: **Big bro, as long as you're happy**.

### 2.3 The Back-and-Forth of Technical Choices

The technical choices for the CZON project can be described as **Schrödinger's decision-making**:

**Timeline**:
- 2026-01-10: Completed JSX rendering refactoring
- 2026-01-10: Shelved custom theme functionality
- 2026-01-10: Decided to use JSX to implement themes
- 2026-01-10: Shelved custom theme functionality again

Wait, does January 10, 2026, have some kind of magic?

Looking closely at the document, oh, on the same day:
1. Completed JSX rendering refactoring
2. Shelved custom theme functionality
3. Decided to use JSX to implement themes
4. Shelved custom theme functionality again

**So, is JSX being used or not?**

The answer is: **Yes, but not now; shelved, but not forever**.

This kind of **quantum superposition** product decision, I'd like to call it the **CZON Uncertainty Principle**.

### 2.4 Philosophical Reflections on Theme Functionality

Regarding whether to implement custom theme functionality, this guy engaged in deep (and possibly unnecessary) contemplation:

> "Handlebars' advantage is simplicity and ease of use, its disadvantage is limited functionality, with a lower ceiling. Using JSX... has a higher ceiling, but a steeper learning curve."

> "But these days, with AI generating everything directly, what's there to learn about template languages?"

> ![学习，学个屁](https://www.diydoutu.com/bq/1889new.gif)

**Wow, the AI-era solution: don't do it**.

This reminds me of a joke:

> Q: How to solve a complex technical problem?
> A: Skip it.

## 3. Love-Hate Relationship with AI

### 3.1 Vibe-kanban's "One-Second True Love"

This guy's feelings after using vibe-kanban:

> "I quickly realized my bottleneck shifted to creating new tasks and reviewing tasks. In short, enjoyed it for a second, then wasn't happy again."

**One-second true love**.

This reminds me of those friends who **sign up for a gym membership on the first day**.

Then he reflected on why this happened:

> "My bottleneck shifted to creating new tasks and reviewing tasks... The sense of unease didn't disappear because I used vibe-kanban."

So vibe-kanban didn't solve the root problem. What is the root problem?

> "There's a contradiction between my desire for control over details and my desire for rapid progress."

Translation: **I want it fast, good, and under complete control**.

This reminds me of a formula: **Even a deity can't do it = Mortal + Greed**.

### 3.2 The Waterloo of AI Programming

Regarding AI writing code, this guy has a bellyful of grievances:

> "Vibe Coding was a massive failure. The code quality AI wrote for me was too poor, completely unusable. Had no choice but to rewrite the entire ZEN project."

Note this timeline:
1. Used AI to generate code
2. Iterated multiple rounds
3. Engineering quality collapsed
4. Rewrote the entire project

**So all that time spent before was for nothing?**

He also summarized the **Four Major Sins** of AI writing OOP code:

1. AI's design capability for object-oriented programming paradigms is insufficient
2. AI isn't clear whether it's writing one-off code or code for long-term maintenance
3. Lack of an AI-friendly scaffolding
4. AI is overly conservative in handling compatibility requirements

**Translation into plain language**:
- AI doesn't understand business domain modeling
- AI is lazy, just wants it to run
- AI has no scaffolding
- AI is afraid to delete code

**Isn't that me?** (Not really)

### 3.3 Claude Code's Tone Test

On January 18, 2026, this guy did something very (pointlessly) interesting with Claude Code:

**Testing AI summary tones**.

1. Objective, neutral tone → "Not bad"
2. Sarcastic tone → "Too sarcastic, it's a sarcasm that ignores facts"
3. Sycophantic tone → "Too sycophantic, it's a sycophancy that ignores facts"

**So the conclusion is**: AI's tone-rewriting function is, **in fact, fact-ignoring**.

Isn't that obvious? Why spend time testing it?

Then he abruptly changed direction:

> "This thing, if made into a product, would likely be very viral, easily becoming a hit."

**Wow, testing aside, the commercialization mindset is already activated**.

This guy's brain is always seamlessly switching between **finding problems** and **finding business opportunities**.

## 4. The Metaphysics of Quantitative Trading

### 4.1 Profit-Based Scaling: The Legend of 16 Consecutive Wins

This guy proposed a **world-shaking, tear-jerking** strategy: **Profit-Based Scaling**.

Core logic:
1. Profitable → Scale up
2. Loss → Stop loss
3. Stop-loss condition → Loss reaches the level before scaling

**Simple, crude, but effective**.

He even gave an example:

> "There's a guy on X who shared his experience going from $12 to $100,000, mainly relying on a profit-based All-in strategy, achieving this feat through 16 consecutive wins."

**16 consecutive wins**.

My math isn't great: $12 × (1+1)^16 = $12 × 65536 = $786,432 ≈ $790,000.

But he said $100,000.

So maybe it wasn't doubling every time, or the scaling proportion varied each time.

**Anyway, 16 consecutive wins sounds like winning the lottery jackpot**.

He also said:

> "In pure gambling games, this is mostly luck. But in market trading, tailwinds and headwinds often cluster..."

**So there are "tailwinds" in the market?**

This reminds me of a meme: **The wind is here, time to fly**.

### 4.2 Protracted Warfare: 10 Years vs. 10 Years

Regarding investment strategies, this guy wrote a **grand treatise** titled "Capital Protracted Warfare."

He refuted three "erroneous views":
1. The Inevitable Defeat of Individuals Theory
2. The Steady Development Theory
3. The All-In Get Rich Quick Theory

When refuting the "Steady Development Theory," he wrote:

> "If you want to earn 20 million a year... the Steady Development Theory... by the time assets increase tenfold, it's ten years later... wealth doesn't arrive when the individual needs it most."

**Translation**: Ten years is too long, I can't wait.

But his protracted warfare strategy is essentially a long-term strategy too.

**So it's: Long-term but not too long-term?**

This kind of **Schrödinger's Long-Termism**, I'd like to call it **Quantum Investment Theory**.

### 4.3 Product Design of the EA Project

The product design of the EA project is interesting: **Priority/Subordinated Structure**.

- Priority Capital: Principal protected, floating returns (currently 12% annualized)
- Subordinated Capital: Bears risk, high returns
- Project's Own Capital: Fully invested in the subordinated tranche

**Translation**: Lose my money first, profit together.

This reminds me of a joke:

> Q: How to make investors feel at ease?
> A: Lose your own money first.

**The vision is broadened, folks**.

## 5. Team and Social

### 5.1 Team Composition: XJTU Alumni Association

The EA project's management team has 5 co-founders, all graduates of Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU).

| Member | Role |
|------|------|
| CZ | Project Initiator and Chief Designer |
| Xi Chen | Project Initiator and Chief Advisor (Tenured Professor, NYU Stern School of Business) |
| Ryan | Senior Quantitative Trader |
| Mage | Senior Quantitative Trader |
| Thrimbda | Senior Engineer |

**So this is a story of XJTU alumni starting a business**.

I can almost picture the alumni association annual gathering:

> "We're all XJTU graduates, bottoms up!"

### 5.2 Social Interactions

This guy's social life is quite rich:

**Dinner with Hobo**:
> "I envy that he, working at a foreign company, can use GPT, Claude Opus, and other LLMs without limits for work assistance"

**Discussion with C1**:
> "Yesterday C1 improved the plan for the LegionMind project..."

**Late-night chat with Thrimbda**:
> "Got up at night to chat with Thrimbda about ZEN's future direction"

**Roadshow with institutions**:
> "Yesterday's schedule was packed, first did a roadshow of our strategy and product to institutions, received some recognition."

**So this person is: Roadshows during the day, codes at night, writes documents late at night**?

**Time management master**, I get it now.

### 5.3 Handling User Feedback

A user (C1) gave three pieces of feedback for CZON:
1. Classification is too slow (full classification every time)
2. Needs date tags
3. Needs one-click social media generation

**His reaction**:
> "The others are relatively simple, but the last multi-platform publishing feature is more complex, requires integrating with various platform APIs, might take some time."

**Translation**:
- Features 1 and 2: Minor
- Feature 3: A bit complex, but doable

**Final proposed solution**:
> "The simplest way is to generate text & images in the corresponding format, then users copy and paste to each platform themselves."

**So AI generation + manual copying**.

**This is very AI-Native**: AI does the thinking, humans do the manual work.

## 6. Writing Style Appreciation

### 6.1 Diary Opening Template

All of this guy's LOGS documents share a common trait: **They always start with the date**.

> "It's now 2026-01-05."
> "Today is 2026-01-07."
> "It's now the evening of January 8, 2026."
> "It's now the early morning of January 9, 2026."
> "It's now the early morning of January 9, 2026."

**Early morning**. Again, early morning.

**How much does this guy have to say that must be said in the early morning?**

> "Recording ZEN's to-do list..."

> "Today is also an early-rising day, woke up after 7."

**"Early" rising after 7**.

Seems in CZ's world, sleeping before midnight + waking up after 7 = healthy living.

Respect.

### 6.2 Self-Referencing

This guy loves referencing his own documents:

> "You can refer to this article..."
> "See here..."
> "Specifically, his request can be broken down into..."
> "See the detailed explanation [here](./11.md)."

**As if talking to himself**: Bro, what you said before made sense, look at it again.

This **self-questioning and self-answering** mode, I'd like to call it **a one-man comedy show**.

### 6.3 Memes and Emojis

Although the user requested avoiding emojis, this guy used some images in the documents:

![学习，学个屁](https://www.diydoutu.com/bq/1889new.gif)

![妙啊](妙啊.png)

**So it's not about not using images, it's about using them just right**.

## 7. Golden Quotes Collection

### 7.1 About AI

> "The OOP code quality written by AI is particularly poor. Every new feature gets its own separate class... This isn't object-oriented programming, it's requirement-list-oriented programming."

> "In short, enjoyed it for a second, then wasn't happy again."

> "Its tone-rewriting function is, **in fact, fact-ignoring**."

### 7.2 About Investment

> "In pure gambling games, this is mostly luck. But in market trading, tailwinds and headwinds often cluster."

> "The return of doing something = (Pricing - Cost) × Influence"

> "Influence is an independent multiplier, playing a very important role."

### 7.3 About Life

> "If I learn the truth in the morning, I can die content in the evening."

> "Life is all about experience, inherently meaningless. Understanding everything is my meaning."

> "Different paths lead to the same destination. People with great influence often also have better resources and opportunities to undertake better projects, forming a virtuous cycle."

### 7.4 About Work

> "If one day I'm gone, these will be the raw materials for AI to resurrect me."

> "I quickly realized my bottleneck shifted to creating new tasks and reviewing tasks."

> "Who keeps a diary? Serious people don't."

**The last line**, I can't hold back my laughter.

## 8. Summary

This CZ guy is an existence that is **paradoxical yet unified**:

- He pursues "things happening naturally and effortlessly," yet works more intensely than anyone
- He wants to "let go of the desire to control details," yet his documents are full of details
- He talks about "protracted warfare," yet codes late into the night
- He thinks "serious people don't keep diaries," yet writes logs daily

**But this is precisely where his charm lies**:

> High-energy-consumption brain + Continuous reflection + Interdisciplinary integration + Long-termism + Team cohesion + Business acumen

= **An interesting soul, living life seriously**.

Finally, summarizing with the AI-generated poem from his document:

> A spark of inspiration begins to sprout,
> Tempered a hundred times, its aura grows stout.
> To spread across the seas, it briefly bows low,
> Yet borrows the echo to soar high and go.

**May CZ's CZON enable more people to "soar high and go."**

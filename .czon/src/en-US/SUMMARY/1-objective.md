## Overview

This repository belongs to CZ (also known as zccz14), a professional specializing in quantitative trading and fintech, and the founder of NTNL (No Trade No Life). The repository content encompasses personal reflections, project logs, technical insights, and investment theories, primarily spanning from early to late January 2026.

Main projects include:
- **CZON/CZONE**: An AI-native content creation and static site generation tool.
- **EA (Earnby.AI)**: A priority fund project on the BNB Smart Chain.
- **LegionMind**: An AI agent project management tool integrated with GitHub Project.
- **Yuan**: A project not elaborated in detail.
- Multiple quantitative trading strategies and theoretical frameworks.

## Project Introduction

### CZON / CZONE
- **Origin**: Renamed from the ZEN project, aiming to provide a zero-configuration, AI-native content management experience.
- **Core Features**:
  - Write in your native language, with AI automatically translating into multiple language versions.
  - Automatic extraction of metadata (title, summary, keywords).
  - Supports JSX theme rendering with dark mode adaptation.
  - Integrates OpenCode Agent for tasks like translation and summarization.
- **Version Iteration**: From 0.4.x to 0.6.x, progressively addressing issues like avalanche translation caused by hash IDs and directory structure refactoring.
- **Design Philosophy**: C (Content-oriented), Z (Zero-configuration), O (Organic AI-native), N (N-shaped Potential Energy Curve, describing the energy changes in the creation-distribution process).
- **Related Files**: [README.md](../README.md), [INSIGHTS/4.md](../INSIGHTS/4.md), [LOGS/5.md](../LOGS/5.md), etc.

### EA (Earnby.AI)
- **Nature**: An on-chain priority fund on BSC, settled in USDC.
- **Structure**: Divided into priority capital (enjoying principal protection and stable returns) and subordinated capital (bearing risk for higher returns). The project team's own capital is fully invested in the subordinated tranche.
- **Strategies**: Directional portfolio strategy (machine learning for timing) and Delta-neutral strategies (arbitrage, market making, etc.).
- **Historical Performance**: Formerly a private fund launched in March 2024, with a cumulative return of +39.22%, annualized approximately 22%, and a maximum drawdown of 1.12%.
- **Related Files**: [QUANT/EA/EA.md](../QUANT/EA/EA.md).

### LegionMind
- **Positioning**: An AI agent project management tool, integrated with GitHub Project Kanban.
- **Goal**: To provide a kanban experience similar to vibe-kanban, while leveraging the GitHub ecosystem for task-repository linking, mobile access, etc.
- **Related Files**: [LOGS/14.md](../LOGS/14.md).

## Key Themes

### 1. Human-AI Collaboration & AI Agents
- **Module-Level Human-AI Collaboration Architecture**: Proposes establishing trust mechanisms through protocol specifications, unit tests, and benchmarks to reduce manual intervention ([INSIGHTS/1.md](../INSIGHTS/1.md)).
- **Controllable Trust Problem**: Suggests the desire for control stems from fear of uncontrolled consequences, proposing a two-layer multiplicative model of "Intent Alignment × Risk Control Triangle" ([INSIGHTS/2.md](../INSIGHTS/2.md)).
- **Agent Systems Under LLM Constraints**: Advocates embracing the "limitations" of LLMs, achieving "infinite" expansion at the system level through coordination engineering, AI decision economics, and cognitive flow management ([INSIGHTS/3.md](../INSIGHTS/3.md)).
- **Inspiration from Su Yu's Combat Orders**: Transfers principles of military command—standardization, modularization, and protocolization—to a multi-agent collaboration framework ([INSIGHTS/5.md](../INSIGHTS/5.md)).

### 2. Quantitative Trading & Investment Strategies
- **Capital War of Attrition**: Proposes using a controllable daily loss limit (cash flow baseline) to pursue a single victory that could elevate one's social class, emphasizing systematic trading, pyramiding with floating profits, and clearly defining victory conditions ([INSIGHTS/6.md](../INSIGHTS/6.md), [LOGS/26.md](../LOGS/26.md)).
- **Full Spectrum Analysis (FSA)**: Extends the Kelly Criterion for calculating optimal leverage in multi-outcome spaces ([QUANT/FSA/FSA.md](../QUANT/FSA/FSA.md)).
- **Private Fund Industry Analysis**: Based on the Guotai Haitong 2025 In-depth Analysis Conference on Securities Private Funds, compiling data on market size, strategy performance, factor exposure, etc. ([MEETINGS/2026-01-22.md](../MEETINGS/2026-01-22.md)).

### 3. Content Creation & Distribution
- **AI-Native Content Engine**: Summarizes the first-principle of "deep creation, shallow distribution" ([INSIGHTS/4.md](../INSIGHTS/4.md)).
- **CZON's N-Shaped Potential Energy Curve**: Describes the energy changes in content from inspiration surge (low point), meticulous crafting (rise), adaptation for distribution (decline), to audience resonance (rise again) ([LOGS/11.md](../LOGS/11.md), [LOGS/12.md](../LOGS/12.md)).
- **Multi-Platform Summary Generation**: Designs summaries of varying lengths and purposes for SEO, social media, content previews, etc. ([LOGS/7.md](../LOGS/7.md)).

### 4. Daily Logs & Experiments
- **Tool Usage Experience**: Records interactions with AI tools like Claude Code, OpenCode, MiniMax M2.1, including success and failure cases (e.g., permission issues, translation quality, model deprecation).
- **Project Progress**: Detailed logs of CZON feature development and refactoring processes.
- **Team Collaboration**: Mentions discussions and task division with members like C1, Hobo, Jige (Chicken Bro), Ryan.
- **Industry Observations**: Focuses on cutting-edge developments like the DeepSeek Engram paper, Claude Constitution, Ralph-loop, etc.

## Theoretical Framework Summary

### Capital War of Attrition
- **Core Idea**: Use losses you can afford to pursue a gain you "cannot afford" to miss.
- **Four No's Principle**: No risk-taking (control loss rate), no waste (systematic trading to accumulate advantage), no delay (pyramid with floating profits), no ambiguity (clearly define victory conditions).
- **Mathematical Interpretation**: Set risk control line `F(t) ≥ -C·t`, use profits `P(t)` for pyramiding, aiming for capital curve `F(T_W) ≥ A` (victory target).
- **Practical Rules**: Stable cash flow input, systematic trading, pyramid with profits.

### Full Spectrum Analysis (FSA)
- **Basis**: Extends the Kelly Criterion, applicable to multi-outcome spaces.
- **Input**: Outcome space `X`, return for each outcome `R_i`, probability `P_i`.
- **Output**: Optimal leverage `k_o` that maximizes compound return `C(X,k)`.
- **Application**: Used for position sizing in quantitative trading.

### Controllable Trust Model
- **Formula**: Controllable Trust = Intent Alignment Index × Risk Control Index.
- **Intent Alignment**: Expressive alignment, value alignment, structural alignment, dynamic alignment.
- **Risk Control Triangle**: Predictability, intervenability, recoverability.

### Coordination Engineering, AI Decision Economics, Cognitive Flow Management
- **Coordination Engineering**: Externalizes the coordination burden within LLMs into system processes (checklists, parliamentary debates, constraint solvers).
- **AI Decision Economics**: Optimizes resource allocation under finite compute budgets through market-like mechanisms.
- **Cognitive Flow Management**: Abandons the fantasy of cognitive compression, manages information flow through progressive loading and iterative alignment loops.

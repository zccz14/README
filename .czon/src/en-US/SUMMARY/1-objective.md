## Project Introduction

### CZON

- **Origin**: A project initiated and developed by CZ, originally named ZEN and later renamed CZON. C stands for Content Oriented, Z for Zero Configuration, O for Organic AI-Native, and N for N-shaped Content Creation and Distribution Energy Curve.
- **Core Features**:
  - Write content in your native language, automatically translated into multiple language versions.
  - AI automatically generates permanent links.
  - AI automatically extracts summaries and metadata.
  - Supports custom JSX themes.
  - Automatically generates SEO-optimized content.
  - Dark mode support.
  - Generates sitemaps and crawler rules.
  - Supports static resource referencing.

### EA (Earnby.AI)

- **Origin**: The EA project launched in November 2025, evolving from a private fund operational since March 2024. The project is deployed on the BSC (BNB Smart Chain) and uses USDC as the settlement currency.
- **Core Features**:
  - Stablecoin principal-protected wealth management; priority funds enjoy principal protection.
  - Floating yield rate, currently at 12% APR.
  - Redeemable at any time; standard redemption unlocks after 168 hours, instant redemption with a 0.5% fee.
- **Strategy Introduction**:
  - Directional Portfolio Strategy: Machine learning model-driven timing trades with leverage ranging from 0-200%.
  - Delta Neutral Strategy: Cross-market arbitrage and hedging with leverage ranging from 0-300%.
- **Historical Performance** (2024-03 to 2025-11):
  - Cumulative Return: +39.22%
  - Annualized Return: ~22%
  - Average Monthly Return: +1.50%
  - Profitable Months Ratio: 95.0% (19/20)
  - Maximum Drawdown: 1.12%

### Capital Protracted War

- **Origin**: The framework was formed in mid-January 2026, stemming from systematic thinking about individual investors crossing class barriers. The core idea is to use controllable losses to seek decisive victories, rather than pursuing stable profits or all-in bets for sudden wealth.
- **Core Features**:
  - Define clear risk boundaries: Set risk control lines, clarify maximum loss speed.
  - Sustained cash inflow: Invest continuously at a fixed rate to ensure always being in the market.
  - Dynamic position management: Increase investment during profits, decrease during losses.
  - Floating profit pyramid strategy: Use floating profits to expand advantages.
- **Mathematical Framework**:
  - The capital curve F(t) must satisfy: F(t) ≥ -C × (t - T₀), where C is the tolerable loss speed.
  - Define profit P(t) = F(t) - C × (t - T₀).
  - When P(t) reaches L, use all floating profits for the next round of investment.

### Full Spectrum Analysis (FSA)

- **Origin**: Formed on August 10, 2025, originating from extended research on the application of the Kelly Criterion in the field of investment trading.
- **Core Features**:
  - Define the outcome space X, containing deterministic return rates and deterministic probabilities.
  - Calculate compound return rate: C(X, k) = (∏(1 + k × Rᵢ)ᴾⁱ) - 1.
  - Solve for optimal leverage: k₀ = argmaxₖ C(X, k).
  - Use Newton's method for numerical solution, handling cases outside the feasible region.

## Key Themes

### 1. AI-Native Software Development

- [Module-Level Human-AI Collaborative Software Engineering Architecture](../INSIGHTS/1.md): Designs an LLM-based engineering architecture for module-level human-AI collaboration, achieving quality control through four layers of specifications: Protocol Spec, Implementation Spec, Test Spec, Benchmark Spec.
- [How to Solve Human Desire for Control – On the Controllable Trust Problem in Human-AI Collaboration](../INSIGHTS/2.md): Proposes a two-layer multiplicative model for controllable trust, including intent alignment and the risk control triangle.
- [Embracing "Finite," Designing "Infinite" – A New Paradigm for Constructing Intelligent Agent Systems Based on LLM Constraints](../INSIGHTS/3.md): Proposes three frameworks—Coordination Engineering, AI Decision Economics, Cognitive Flow Management—to address the three major constraints of LLMs: non-mandatory coordination, limited computational budget, and cognitive incompressibility.
- [Vibe Coding Practical Experience and Reflection](../LOGS/2.md): AI is currently not suitable for writing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) code, tending towards procedural and functional programming; AI is overly conservative about backward compatibility, leading to bloated code.
- [Experience Integrating OpenCode for Translation Tasks](../LOGS/23.md): Agents perform worse than one-shot LLMs on translation tasks; Agent advantages lie more in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and decision-making.

### 2. Multi-Agent System Collaboration

- [From Battlefield to Digital Space: On the Inspirational Significance of Su Yu's Combat Orders for a New Era Multi-Agent System Collaboration Framework](../INSIGHTS/5.md): Migrates the organizational logic of Su Yu's large-scale military command to AI multi-agent collaboration, proposing four principles: Situation Alignment, Task Decoupling, Protocol Standardization, Central Coordination.
- [Multi-Agents: Adversarial Generation Translation](../LOGS/26.md): Introduces translation Agents and review Agents for adversarial generation, significantly improving translation quality, but token consumption is approximately 10 times or more than regular translation.
- [Control Constraints and Memory Optimization for Multi-Agents](../LOGS/27.md): Distinguishes between soft constraints (Agent controlling Agent) and hard constraints (Script controlling Agent), proposing a hybrid solution using an Orchestrator Agent to generate Scripts.

### 3. Quantitative Investment & Capital Strategy

- [The Mathematical Essence of Leverage](../LOGS/25.md): Leverage and volatility are mathematically equivalent in essence and can be converted into each other; proposes the distinction between on-exchange leverage and off-exchange leverage and their respective cost structures.
- [Debate: Capital Protracted War vs. Steady Growth](../DEBATES/奇葩说4v4辩论-稳健增长vs跨越阶级.md): Presents the pros and cons of the Steady Growth and Class-Leaping strategies in the format of a "Qi Pa Shuo" debate.
- [Meeting Minutes: In-depth Analysis of Guotai Haitong 2025 Securities Private Fund](../MEETINGS/2026-01-22.md): Records that the private fund market size reached 7.04 trillion CNY, factor influence is increasing, the head effect is pronounced, and the organic combination of subjective and quantitative is the future trend.

### 4. Content Creation & Distribution

- [From Creation to Distribution – Building an AI-Native Content Engine](../INSIGHTS/4.md): Proposes the core principle of "Deep Creation, Shallow Distribution." Content creation is a deepening process from perception to cognition, while content distribution needs to avoid information overload.
- [The 'N' in CZON: The Potential Energy Change Curve from Content Creation to Distribution](../LOGS/11.md): Content creation starts with low potential energy, which rises as it's refined; publishing involves a dimensionality reduction projection causing a drop; audience feedback causes potential energy to rise again, forming an N-shaped curve.
- [Experiment with AI-Generated Community Comments](../LOGS/20.md): Explores the possibility of AI-generated comments to enhance content interactivity, considering adding a comment section and a decentralized user identity system in the future.

### 5. Cognitive Development & Complexity Management

- [Returning to Simplicity: Complexity is an Inevitable Path of Cognition](../INSIGHTS/7.md): Quotes Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., pointing out that the simplicity on the other side of complexity is the true simplicity; good abstraction must be built upon a deep understanding of the problem domain.
- [Reflection on AI Programming Practice: Avoiding OOP and Over-Compatibility](../LOGS/2.md): AI is currently not suitable for writing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) code; OOP requires deep understanding and modeling capabilities of the business domain, which AI currently cannot handle.
- [The Power of Idealized Limit Thinking](../LOGS/24.md): Inspired by the Ralph-loop experiment, understanding the essence of things more clearly by removing limitations.

### Capital Protracted War

-   **Origin**: The framework was formed in mid-January 2026, stemming from systematic thinking about the issue of individual investors crossing class barriers. The core idea is to use controllable losses to seek decisive victories, rather than pursuing stable profits or going all-in for sudden wealth.
-   **Core Features**:
    -   Define clear risk boundaries: Set risk control lines, clarify maximum loss speed.
    -   Continuous cash inflow: Invest at a fixed rate to ensure always being in the market.
    -   Dynamic position management: Increase investment during profits, decrease during losses.
    -   Pyramiding strategy: Use floating profits to expand advantages.
-   **Mathematical Framework**:
    -   The capital curve F(t) must satisfy: F(t) ≥ -C × (t - T₀), where C is the tolerable loss speed.
    -   Define profit P(t) = F(t) - C × (t - T₀).
    -   When P(t) reaches L, use all floating profits for the next round of investment.

### Full Spectrum Analysis (FSA)

-   **Origin**: Formed on August 10, 2025, stemming from extended research on the application of the Kelly Criterion in the field of investment trading.
-   **Core Features**:
    -   Define the outcome space X, containing deterministic return rates and deterministic probabilities.
    -   Calculate compound return: C(X, k) = (∏(1 + k × Rᵢ)ᴾⁱ) - 1.
    -   Solve for optimal leverage: k₀ = argmaxₖ C(X, k).
    -   Use Newton's method for numerical solution, handling cases outside the feasible region.

## Key Themes

### 1. AI-Native Software Development

-   [Module-Level Human-AI Collaborative Software Engineering Architecture](../INSIGHTS/1.md): Designs an LLM-based engineering architecture for module-level human-AI collaboration, achieving quality control through four layers of specifications: Protocol Spec, Implementation Spec, Test Spec, Benchmark Spec.
-   [How to Solve Human Desire for Control – On Controllable Trust in Human-AI Collaboration](../INSIGHTS/2.md): Proposes a two-layer multiplicative model for controllable trust, including intent alignment and the risk control triangle.
-   [Embrace "Finite", Design "Infinite" – A New Paradigm for Constructing Agent Systems Based on LLM Constraints](../INSIGHTS/3.md): Proposes three frameworks—Coordination Engineering, AI Decision Economics, Cognitive Flow Management—to address the three major constraints of LLMs: non-mandatory coordination, finite computational budget, and cognitive incompressibility.
-   [Vibe Coding Practical Experience and Reflection](../LOGS/2.md): AI is currently not suitable for writing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) code, tending towards procedural and functional programming; AI is overly conservative about backward compatibility, leading to bloated code.
-   [Experience Integrating OpenCode for Translation Tasks](../LOGS/23.md): Agents perform worse than one-shot LLMs on translation tasks; Agent advantages lie more in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and decision-making.

### 2. Multi-Agent System Collaboration

-   [From Battlefield to Digital Space: On the Inspirational Significance of Su Yu's Combat Orders for a New Era Multi-Agent System Collaboration Framework](../INSIGHTS/5.md): Migrates the organizational logic of Su Yu's large-scale military command to AI multi-agent collaboration, proposing four principles: Situation Alignment, Task Decoupling, Protocol Standardization, and Central Coordination.
-   [Multi-Agents: Adversarial Generation Translation](../LOGS/26.md): Introduces translation Agents and review Agents for adversarial generation, significantly improving translation quality, but token consumption is approximately 10 times or more than regular translation.
-   [Control Constraints and Memory Optimization for Multi-Agents](../LOGS/27.md): Distinguishes between soft constraints (Agent controlling Agent) and hard constraints (Script controlling Agent), proposing a hybrid solution using an Orchestrator Agent to generate Scripts.

### 3. Quantitative Investment and Capital Strategy

-   [The Mathematical Essence of Leverage](../LOGS/25.md): Leverage and volatility are mathematically equivalent and can be converted into each other; proposes the distinction between on-exchange leverage and off-exchange leverage and their respective cost structures.
-   [Debate: Capital Protracted War vs. Steady Growth](../DEBATES/奇葩说4v4辩论-稳健增长vs跨越阶级.md): Presents the pros and cons of the Steady Growth and Class Leap strategies in the format of a "Qi Pa Shuo" debate.
-   [Meeting Minutes: In-depth Analysis of Securities Private Funds by Guotai Haitong in 2025](../MEETINGS/2026-01-22.md): Records that the private fund market size reached 7.04 trillion yuan, factor influence is increasing, the head effect is pronounced, and the organic combination of subjective and quantitative approaches is the future trend.

### 4. Content Creation and Distribution

-   [From Creation to Distribution – Building an AI-Native Content Engine](../INSIGHTS/4.md): Proposes the core principle of "Deep Creation, Shallow Distribution." Content creation is a deepening process from perception to cognition, while content distribution needs to avoid information overload.
-   [The Meaning of 'N' in CZON: The Potential Energy Change Curve from Content Creation to Distribution](../LOGS/11.md): The starting point of content creation is low, with potential energy rising as it's refined; publishing involves a dimensionality reduction projection causing potential energy to drop; audience feedback causes potential energy to rise again, forming an N-shaped curve.
-   [Experiment with AI-Generated Community Comments](../LOGS/20.md): Explores the possibility of AI generating comments to enhance content interactivity, considering adding a comment section and a decentralized user identity system in the future.

### 5. Cognitive Development and Complexity Management

-   [Returning to Simplicity: Complexity is an Inevitable Path of Cognition](../INSIGHTS/7.md): Quotes Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., pointing out that the simplicity on the other side of complexity is the true simplicity; good abstraction must be built upon a deep understanding of the problem domain.
-   [Reflection on AI Programming Practice: Avoiding OOP and Over-Compatibility](../LOGS/2.md): AI is currently not suitable for writing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) code; OOP requires deep understanding and modeling capabilities of the business domain, which AI currently cannot handle.
-   [The Power of Idealized Limit Thinking](../LOGS/24.md): Inspired by the Ralph-loop experiment, understanding the essence of things more clearly by removing constraints.

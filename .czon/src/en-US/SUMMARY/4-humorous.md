"title": "AI Analysis Report: Humorous and Teasing Style"
"summary": "This AI-generated report, in a humorous and teasing style, analyzes multiple aspects of CZ (zccz14): He describes himself as a 'high-energy-consumption brain', maintains an elderly sleep schedule of waking up at 5 AM, yet productively pushes projects forward; explores the meaning of 'N' in CZON, representing the energy curve of content creation; points out AI's limitations in object-oriented programming, favoring traditional programming; shares the 'Controllable Trust Theory' to balance control desires with efficiency; proposes a 'Capital Protracted War' investment strategy emphasizing stable cash flow and programmatic trading; applies Su Yu's combat logic to multi-agent system design; emphasizes the importance of the influence formula (Profit = (Price - Cost) × Influence); explains the origin of the name CZON; reflects on the flaws of AI tone rewriting; shares experiences in chasing trends and writing work logs. The report reveals CZ's contradictory traits—pursuing natural progression while juggling multiple projects, wanting to let go of control yet constructing theories—and ultimately concludes that 'feeling uncomfortable all over is a sign of progress.'"

## 1. On the Daily Life of a "High-Energy-Consumption Brain"

If you wake up at 5 AM and find someone writing an article about "Inspirations from Su Yu's Combat Instructions for Multi-Agent Systems," don't be surprised. This is just a typical day for CZ (aka zccz14).

In [README.md](./../README.md), he introduces himself like this: **High-energy-consumption brain, enjoys thinking and writing, pursues natural progression and smooth outcomes**.

Translated into plain language: This person's brain never stops. He feels restless until he figures things out, restless until he writes them down, and restless until he shares them online for everyone to see.

This "restlessness syndrome" is what we generally call—high productivity.

## 2. What Does the 'N' in CZON Mean?

In [LOGS/11.md](./../LOGS/11.md), the 'N' in CZON finally gets an official explanation: **N-shaped Content Creation and Distribution Energy Curve**.

In plain language: The potential energy change curve for content creation and distribution.

Imagine this 'N':
- Starting point: A flash of inspiration, very low potential energy.
- Rise: Frantic writing and polishing, potential energy soars.
- Fall: Adapting to various platforms before publishing, compromising, potential energy drops.
- Rise again: Audience feedback arrives, potential energy surges once more.

So this 'N' is essentially the EKG of a content creator.

CZON even provided an official accompanying poem:

> A spark of thought, potential just born,
> Forged a hundred times, its spirit grows strong.
> To spread far and wide, it briefly bows low,
> Yet borrows echoes to soar high and glow.

Rough translation: Writing feels great, publishing requires humility, but as long as someone likes it, I'm back on top.

## 3. AI Writing Code? Hah.

In [LOGS/7.md](./../LOGS/7.md), CZ documents a painful AI programming experience. His exact words: "Using AI to generate code from scratch, after multiple iterations, the project quality began to collapse."

What does AI-written OOP code look like? CZ describes it: "Every new feature gets its own separate class, and then it punches a hole in other related classes to call it."

In plain language: AI writes code like some people write weekly reports—create as many as possible, procrastinate when you can, ending up with an incomprehensible legacy mess.

The lesson? **AI is currently not suitable for writing object-oriented programming code**. Traditional programming (procedural/functional) is still the way to go.

Of course, CZ also mentioned this might be because AI lacks modeling of business domain concepts. Translation: AI is just an intern who's memorized tons of code but never held a real job. Ask it to write complex code, and it can only perform "copying the gourd to draw the ladle."

---

## 4. On the Small Matter of Control Issues

In [LOGS/1.md](./../LOGS/1.md), CZ falls into deep self-doubt:

> There is a contradiction between my desire for control over details and my desire for rapid progress.

Plain language: Doing things fast risks poor quality, doing things well takes too long. Life is hard.

Later, he had an epiphany: How do technical leads dare to let go of their control over details? Because they have systems!

Then he wrote [INSIGHTS/2.md](./../INSIGHTS/2.md), proposing the **Controllable Trust Theory**. The core idea: As long as the acceptance criteria are clear enough, humans, with a "it's usable enough" mindset, will let AI's code slide.

This is probably the legendary—out of sight, out of mind.jpg

## 5. On Protracted War in the Investment Market

[INSIGHTS/6.md](./../INSIGHTS/6.md) introduces the concept of a "Capital Protracted War." Sounds intimidating, right?

Plain language:
1. Don't think you're doomed to fail in the market—you still have a tiny bit of an edge.
2. Don't think taking it slow guarantees success—you'll be old by the time you succeed.
3. Don't think going all-in once will bring financial freedom—going all-in usually means the market goes all-in on you.

So what should you do? Three key strategies:
1. Secure a stable cash flow (salary income).
2. Use programmatic trading to avoid emotional decisions.
3. Add to winning positions (pyramiding).

Plain language: Put some money in every month, buy and pretend to be dead, buy more when it rises, and when it falls—just pretend you didn't see it.

Of course, CZ also mentioned this strategy requires "strict stop-loss conditions." So it's probably a "play dead but not completely dead" strategy.

## 6. General Su Yu Time-Travels to the AI World

In [INSIGHTS/5.md](./../INSIGHTS/5.md), CZ does something highly interdisciplinary—he transplants the command logic of Su Yu's large-scale military operations into multi-agent system design.

Su Yu's combat order structure:
- Enemy situation assessment
- Our army's decision
- Tasks for each unit
- Coordination matters
- Support

CZ transformed it into an AI multi-agent framework:
- Situation and task analysis
- Objectives and success criteria
- Role and task assignment
- Interaction protocols
- Central coordination and monitoring

This move is called—**using magic to defeat magic, using war to defeat AI**.

He even gave a concrete example: How to use Su Yu-style instructions to make AI write a "Strategic Analysis Report on Responding to Competitor A's New Product."

After reading it, the feeling is: If General Su Yu knew his combat philosophy was being used to command AI to write business reports, he'd probably die of anger all over again.

## 7. The Self-Cultivation of Waking Up at 5 AM

In [LOGS/14.md](./../LOGS/14.md), CZ writes:

> Another super early morning, woke up a little after 5.

Note the word "another," indicating this isn't the first time.

Even more bizarre, he goes to sleep around 9 PM.

What kind of schedule is this? Wake at 5 AM, sleep at 9 PM. Isn't this the classic elderly作息 (sleep schedule)?

Of course, considering his "high-energy-consumption brain"定位 (positioning), it makes sense. Probably his brain is a high-power CPU that needs more time to cool down.

By the way, he actually sleeps 8-9 hours. So it's not sleep deprivation, just an early bedtime.

The only problem with this schedule: Waking up at 5 AM and posting "Good morning" on social media makes normal people feel intensely guilty.

---

## 8. On the "Small Matter" of Influence

In [LOGS/14.md](./../LOGS/14.md), CZ proposes a profit formula:

> Profit from doing something = (Price - Cost) × Influence

Plain language: Just being good at your work isn't enough; you need to let more people know you're doing it.

This formula's greatest contribution: It explains why some people, despite average skills, thrive spectacularly.

Of course, CZ also said, "Different paths lead to the same destination. People with greater influence often have better resources and opportunities to work on better projects."

Translation: The strong get stronger, the weak get weaker. The Matthew effect is an eternal truth.

So the conclusion? **Not only do it, but also let people know you're doing it**.

---

## 9. The Origin of the Name CZON

In [LOGS/5.md](./../LOGS/5.md), CZ explains why he changed ZEN to CZON:

> Searched a bunch of names, finally thought CZON was good, representing cz + zone (cz zone, content zone), meaning a zone of content, a zone of knowledge. czon wasn't taken on npm.

Plain language: Did a random search, picked one nobody was using.

The official explanation, of course, is: C=Content Oriented, Z=Zero Configuration, O=Organic AI-Native, N=N-shaped Energy Curve.

It's not easy to凑 (come up with) four letters. Use it and cherish it.

By the way, the original ZEN was overused on GitHub. This is probably: There are hundreds named Zen, but only one named CZON.

## 10. On AI Summarizing Itself in 7 Tones

In [LOGS/17.md](./../LOGS/17.md), CZ used Claude Code to summarize his own documents and discovered an interesting phenomenon:

- Objective, neutral tone: Acceptable.
- Sarcastic tone: Too sarcastic, sarcastic for the sake of it, ignores facts.
- Sycophantic tone: Too sycophantic, sycophantic for the sake of it, ignores facts.

Conclusion: **AI's tone rewriting function, in fact, ignores facts**.

This is probably the so-called—AI's mouth, a deceiving ghost.

However, after adding prompts later, the critical and literary versions turned out "surprisingly good."

So the conclusion is: AI isn't unusable; you just have to teach it how to behave.

## 11. On the Correct Posture for Chasing Trends

In [LOGS/14.md](./../LOGS/14.md), CZ shares an experience chasing a trend:

> Yesterday, I did some summaries of DeepSeek's Engram paper, simply posted a news comment on social media, which sparked some discussion.

The discussion大概 (probably) went like this:
- Someone asked: What's Engram?
- Someone said: Too long, didn't read.
- Someone said: ZC is awesome.

This is the红利 (dividend) of chasing trends—as long as you understand it just a little earlier than most, you gain attention.

Of course, CZ also said this was just "summarizing the paper's content." Plain language: **I have no original观点 (viewpoints), but I translate well**.

---

## 12. On "Who Keeps a Diary? Decent People Don't."

In [LOGS/17.md](./../LOGS/17.md), CZ mentions a meme he played with years ago:

> Back then, I was actually just playing with a meme, a line from the movie *Hidden Man*.

The line: "Decent people, who keeps a diary?"

Now? CZ himself writes something类似 (similar to) a diary. He admits:

> What I write as a "diary" isn't entirely a diary; it's more like a work log.

Plain language: **I'm not writing a diary; I'm accumulating material to train an AI to resurrect me someday**.

This思路 (line of thinking) is大概 (probably): Since I have to write anyway, might as well make it more meaningful. Who knows, maybe AI really can resurrect me one day?

---

## Conclusion

This is an existence full of contradictions:
- A high-energy-consumption brain, yet maintains an elderly sleep schedule.
- Pursues "natural progression and smooth outcomes," yet simultaneously pushes four projects.
- Wants to let go of control, yet writes theory after theory.
- Knows influence is important, yet insists on using the niche Markdown format.

But it's precisely these contradictions that make it all interesting.

Keep up this state of "feeling uncomfortable all over." After all—

**Feeling uncomfortable all over is a sign of progress.**

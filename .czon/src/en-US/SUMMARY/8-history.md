## Phase Division

### Phase 1: Conceptual Foundation (2026-01-05 ~ 2026-01-10)

**Phase Characteristics**: Concentrated output of three INSIGHTS articles, laying the theoretical groundwork for all subsequent work.

**Key Events**:

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|------|------|
| 2026-01-05 | [Modular-Level Human-Machine Collaborative Software Engineering Architecture](../INSIGHTS/1.md) | Proposed a layered collaborative AI engineering framework. |
| 2026-01-05 | [How to Solve Human Desire for Control: On Controllable Trust in Human-Machine Collaboration](../INSIGHTS/2.md) | Proposed the 'Controllable Trust' two-layer multiplicative model. |
| 2026-01-05 | [Embracing 'Limitations', Designing 'Infinity': A New Paradigm for Agent System Construction Based on LLM Constraints](../INSIGHTS/3.md) | Introduced the core concept of the 'Münchhausen Trilemma'. |
| 2026-01-10 | [From Creation to Distribution: Building an AI-Native Content Engine](../INSIGHTS/4.md) | Proposed the 'Deep Creation, Shallow Distribution' content strategy. |

**Main Outputs**:

-   **Controllable Trust Theory**: Multiplicative model of Intent Alignment × Risk Control Triangle.
-   **Trinity Framework**: Coordination Engineering, AI Decision Economics, Cognitive Flow Management.
-   **Fractal Recursive Structure**: Mechanism for hierarchical decomposition from strategic intent to operational intent.

**Ideological Evolution**:

The core proposition of this phase was 'how to build reliable systems under the inherent constraints of LLMs'. The author recognized three major structural constraints of LLMs:
-   Non-mandatory coordination
-   Limited computational budget
-   Cognitive incompressibility

Rather than attempting to eliminate these constraints, the author proposed to 'embrace limitations, design infinity', transforming constraints into design principles through systems engineering methods.

---

### Phase 2: Tool Development (2026-01-07 ~ 2026-01-14)

**Phase Characteristics**: CZON project renamed from ZEN, JSX rendering architecture refactored.

**Key Events**:

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|------|------|
| 2026-01-07 | [Vibe Coding Major Failure, Rewriting ZEN Project](../LOGS/2.md) | Discovered AI's insufficient OOP design capabilities for programming. |
| 2026-01-08 | [Fixed Internal Link Issues](../LOGS/3.md) | Productization of basic functions. |
| 2026-01-08 | [Discussed ZEN's Future Direction with Thrimbda](../LOGS/4.md) | Decision to rename to CZON. |
| 2026-01-09 | [Completed CZON Renaming, Considering JSX Theme Solution](../LOGS/5.md) | Technology stack selection finalized. |
| 2026-01-09 | [JSX Rendering Architecture Design](../LOGS/6.md) | URL → State → HTML architecture established. |
| 2026-01-10 | [Completed JSX Rendering Refactoring](../LOGS/8.md) | Technical architecture upgrade completed. |
| 2026-01-14 | [Inspiration from Su Yu's Combat Orders for Multi-Agent Systems](../INSIGHTS/5.md) | Migration of historical wisdom to the AI domain. |

**Main Outputs**:

-   CZON 0.4.x version series.
-   JSX rendering architecture (URL → State → HTML).
-   Multi-type summary generation function design.

**Ideological Evolution**:

This phase witnessed a shift from 'AI-generated code' to 'manually written core logic'. Key lessons were:
-   AI is currently unsuitable for writing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) code.
-   AI is overly conservative about backward compatibility, leading to bloated code.
-   Occam's Razor principle: Do not multiply entities beyond necessity.

Simultaneously, by analyzing Su Yu's military command art, four core principles for multi-agent collaboration were distilled: Cognitive Unity First, Structure Determines Function, Protocol Over Communication, and Centralized Command with Distributed Execution.

---

### Phase 3: Deepening Exploration (2026-01-14 ~ 2026-01-24)

**Phase Characteristics**: Multi-threaded parallel exploration, dual-track advancement of investment strategy and AI systems.

**Main Outputs**:

-   Core theory of Capital Protracted War: Exchanging controllable losses for victory-level gains.
-   Four Strategic Principles: No Risk, No Waste, No Delay, No Ambiguity.
-   Mathematical interpretation of leverage essence (Leverage = Volatility).

**Ideological Evolution**:

The core theme of this phase was the attempt to transition 'from theory to practice'.

In the investment domain, the author proposed the 'Capital Protracted War' framework, with the core insight being:
-   The traditional investment philosophy of pursuing stable annualized returns is a misguided goal orientation.
-   The real goal should be 'achieving exponential capital growth within defined boundaries'.
-   Optimal risk-reward ratio is achieved through an 'Anti-Martingale Strategy' (adding to winning positions, reducing losing ones).

In the AI systems domain, recognition that multi-agents are not a panacea:
-   Agents are inferior to one-shot LLMs for simple single-step tasks.
-   Agent token consumption is 10x that of LLMs.
-   Agents risk infinite loops, especially when processing certain languages.

**Ideological Evolution**:

The core themes of this phase were 'systematization' and 'validation'.

In the investment domain:
-   Proposed the investment intent dichotomy of 'Power Generation' (positive cash flow/stable returns) vs. 'Power Consumption' (negative cash flow/high payoff).
-   Refactored the experimental framework into a three-layer structure: Market Sequence (object), Signal Strategy (reaction), Betting Strategy (subject).
-   Introduced the concept of 'Signal-Market Fit' (SMF) to evaluate strategy effectiveness.

In the AI systems domain:

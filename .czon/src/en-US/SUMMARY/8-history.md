## Phase Division

### Phase 1: Conceptual Foundation (2026-01-05 ~ 2026-01-10)

**Phase Characteristics**: Concentrated output of three INSIGHTS articles, laying the theoretical foundation for all subsequent work.

**Key Events**:

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|------|------|
| 2026-01-05 | [Modular-Level Human-AI Collaborative Software Engineering Architecture](../INSIGHTS/1.md) | Proposed a layered collaborative AI engineering framework. |
| 2026-01-05 | [How to Address Human Desire for Control: On Controllable Trust in Human-AI Collaboration](../INSIGHTS/2.md) | Proposed the "Controllable Trust" two-layer multiplicative model. |
| 2026-01-05 | [Embracing "Limitations," Designing "Infinity": A New Paradigm for Agent System Construction Based on LLM Constraints](../INSIGHTS/3.md) | Proposed the core concept of the "Münchhausen Trilemma." |
| 2026-01-10 | [From Creation to Distribution: Building an AI-Native Content Engine](../INSIGHTS/4.md) | Proposed the "Deep Creation, Shallow Distribution" content strategy. |

**Main Outputs**:

-   **Controllable Trust Theory**: Multiplicative model of Intent Alignment × Risk Control Triangle.
-   **Trinity Framework**: Coordination Engineering, AI Decision Economics, Cognitive Flow Management.
-   **Fractal Recursive Structure**: Mechanism for hierarchical decomposition from strategic intent to operational intent.

**Ideological Evolution**:

The core proposition of this phase was "how to build reliable systems under the inherent constraints of LLMs." The author recognized three structural constraints of LLMs:
-   Non-mandatory coordination
-   Limited computational budget
-   Cognitive incompressibility

Instead of attempting to eliminate these constraints, the author proposed "embracing limitations to design infinity," transforming constraints into design principles through systems engineering methods.

### Phase 2: Tool Development (2026-01-07 ~ 2026-01-14)

**Phase Characteristics**: CZON project renamed from ZEN, followed by JSX rendering architecture refactoring.

**Key Events**:

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|------|------|
| 2026-01-07 | [Vibe Coding Major Failure, Rewriting ZEN Project](../LOGS/2.md) | Discovered AI's insufficient OOP design capabilities for programming. |
| 2026-01-08 | [Fixed Internal Link Issues](../LOGS/3.md) | Productization of basic functionalities. |
| 2026-01-08 | [Discussed Future Direction of ZEN with Thrimbda](../LOGS/4.md) | Decision to rename to CZON. |

| 2026-01-14 | [Inspiration from Su Yu's Combat Orders for Multi-Agent Systems](../INSIGHTS/5.md) | Migration of historical wisdom to the AI domain. |

**Main Outputs**:

-   CZON 0.4.x version series.
-   JSX rendering architecture (URL → State → HTML).
-   Multi-type summary generation function design.

**Ideological Evolution**:

This phase witnessed a transition from "AI-generated code" to "manually written core logic." The core lessons were:
-   AI is currently unsuitable for writing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) code.
-   AI is overly conservative regarding backward compatibility, leading to bloated code.
-   Occam's Razor principle: Do not multiply entities beyond necessity.

Simultaneously, through the analysis of Su Yu's military command art, four core principles for multi-agent collaboration were distilled: Cognitive Unity First, Structure Determines Function, Protocol Over Communication, and Centralized Command with Distributed Execution.

---

### Phase 3: Deepening Exploration (2026-01-14 ~ 2026-01-24)

**Phase Characteristics**: Multi-threaded parallel exploration, dual-track advancement of investment strategies and AI systems.

-   Core theory of Capital Protracted War: Using controllable losses to secure victory-level gains.
-   Four Strategic Principles: No Risk, No Waste, No Delay, No Ambiguity.
-   Mathematical interpretation of leverage's essence (Leverage = Volatility).

**Ideological Evolution**:

The core theme of this phase was the attempt to transition "from theory to practice."

In the investment domain, the author proposed the "Capital Protracted War" framework, with the core insight being:
-   Traditional investment philosophies pursuing stable annualized returns are misguided goal orientations.
-   The true goal should be "achieving exponential capital growth within defined boundaries."
-   Optimal risk-reward ratio is achieved through an "Anti-Martingale Strategy" (adding to winning positions, reducing losing positions).

In the AI systems domain, the realization that multi-agents are not a panacea:
-   Agents are inferior to one-shot LLMs for simple single-step tasks.
-   Agent token consumption is 10 times that of LLMs.
-   Agents risk infinite loops, especially when processing certain languages.

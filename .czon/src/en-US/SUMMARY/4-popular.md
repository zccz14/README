## What is This?

Imagine someone putting all their thoughts, projects, and learning notes in one place, like a public "brain backup." That's this repository—CZ's Digital Thinking Space.

CZ is a practitioner in quantitative trading and fintech, and also someone who loves thinking and writing. He publicly shares his research findings, project practices, investment thoughts, and technical explorations, forming this content-rich knowledge base.

This repository has three main parts:

**First, the INSIGHTS article series.** These are CZ's core thoughts, covering his insights into multiple fields like AI-human collaboration, investment strategies, and content creation. These articles are not simple notes but systematic discourses born from deep consideration.

**Second, the LOGS series records.** These are summaries of CZ's daily work and life, like a continuously updated diary. From early January to early February 2026, there are records almost every day, including what new tools he used, what pitfalls he encountered, and what new ideas he had. Reading these records, you can feel how a real thinker works.

**Third, Projects & Tools.** CZ doesn't just think; he also acts. He puts his ideas into practice, developing projects like CZON (a content creation tool) and EA (a quantitative investment fund). These projects are not just concepts on paper but are actual tools that can run and be used.

The repository's time span isn't long, about a month, but the content density is high. It showcases how a professional continuously learns, produces, and iterates. Whether you want to learn about cutting-edge AI applications, study investment strategies, or simply see how a serious person thinks and works, this repository is worth a look.

## Core Projects (Explained by Analogy)

### CZON: Like Your Intelligent Writing Assistant

**One-sentence explanation**: A tool that lets you write in your native language and automatically translates it into multiple languages.

**What it can do**:

- **Native Language Writing, Automatic Translation**: It's like hiring a secretary fluent in multiple languages. You just write articles in Chinese, and the secretary translates them into English, Japanese, Spanish, etc. You don't worry about translation details; you focus on the content itself.
- **Automatic Organization and Publishing**: After writing, CZON automatically generates web pages, handles SEO optimization, creates sitemaps, and everything else needed for publishing. It's like having a thoughtful butler; you just create, and it handles the rest.
- **Intelligent Categorization and Tagging**: You don't need to categorize articles yourself. CZON reads your content and automatically tags and classifies it. It's like having a librarian who knows you; you hand them a book, and they know exactly which shelf it belongs on.

**Why it's useful**: For content creators, writing is tiring enough. Having to handle translation, formatting, and publishing is even more distracting. CZON's goal is to let you focus on creation and leave the rest to the tool. It's like switching from hand-washing clothes to using a washing machine—the clothes are the same, but you save a lot of time and effort.

**Especially noteworthy is the "N-Shaped Potential Energy Curve"**: CZ proposes an interesting view—a content's lifecycle resembles the letter N. It starts as a low-potential spark; after refinement, the content improves and potential rises; for publishing, it needs to adapt to different platforms, requiring a "dimensional reduction," so potential dips; after publication, reader feedback causes potential to rise again. Understanding this curve helps you better plan your creative rhythm.

### EA Project: Like Opening a "Smart Bank"

**One-sentence explanation**: An intelligent wealth management tool that helps you manage idle money for stable returns.

**What it can do**:

- **Principal-Protected Investment**: Like a bank deposit, your principal is safe. This is thanks to a structure called "priority/subordinated tranches"—CZ and the team use their own money to bear the risk, protecting investors' funds.
- **Floating Returns**: The current annualized return is around 12%. It's like depositing money in a bank; the bank invests it, shares profits with you, and absorbs losses itself.
- **Redeemable Anytime**: Unlike some financial products with lock-up periods, EA allows redemption at any time. Standard redemption arrives in 7 days; for urgent needs, paying a 0.5% fee allows instant access.

**Why it's useful**: For ordinary people who want their idle money to earn something but don't want high risk, EA offers an option. You don't need to study candlestick charts, monitor markets, or worry about principal safety. Just put money in and periodically check returns. It's like handing money to a reliable steward who manages it without you needing to worry.

**The backstory**: EA's predecessor was a private fund operating since March 2024, with over a year of live performance records. Cumulative return: +39.22%, annualized return ~22%, profitable months account for 95% (19 out of 20 months), maximum drawdown only 1.12%. These numbers show the team has real skill.

### Capital Protracted War Framework: Like Formulating a "Smart Gambling Strategy"

**One-sentence explanation**: A set of investment methodologies teaching you how to pursue large returns while controlling risk.

**What it can do**:

- **Set a Loss Bottom Line**: Like deciding before playing cards: "What's the most I'll lose this round?" Capital Protracted War requires you to clarify before entering: What's my maximum loss? At what point do I stop losses? This gives you peace of mind.
- **Continuous Small Investments**: Not going all-in at once, but investing a little daily (or weekly). It's like not betting a fortune at a casino but playing steadily at the table, staying in the game, waiting for good opportunities.
- **Add to Winning Positions**: Increase investment when making profits, letting profits run. It's like using winnings to place more bets, aiming for more gains. This is counterintuitive for most people—they tend to add to losing positions to average down and take profits quickly from winning ones.
- **Define Victory Conditions**: When is it a "win"? Not a vague "make money," but a clear numerical target. Like finishing a game level, you know what level you need to reach to win.

**Why it's useful**: Ordinary investors most commonly err by being either too conservative (only daring to save in banks) or too aggressive (borrowing to go all-in). Capital Protracted War offers a middle, rational choice. It tells you: You can pursue high returns, but use a scientific, controlled method. It's not betting on luck but on probability.

**A vivid analogy**: Imagine running on a track. On the left are the "Steady Growth" folks, moving at a constant, slow but steady pace. On the right are the "Class Leap" folks, trying to sprint but prone to falling. Capital Protracted War is like a third path: You set a safety line (risk control line). Within it, you can sprint; if you cross it, you stop immediately. This method lets you pursue high returns without risking ruin.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration System: Like Forming an "AI Special Forces Team"

**One-sentence explanation**: A method for multiple AI agents to divide labor, collaborate, and complete complex tasks together.

**What it can do**:

- **Division of Labor and Collaboration**: Like an army with scouts, communicators, snipers, and logistics personnel, each with a role. The multi-agent system also has AIs with different roles: one for gathering information, one for analysis, one for execution, one for review.
- **Standardized Communication**: How do different AIs communicate? Using a unified "protocol." Like an army having standard communication frequencies and codes, avoiding miscommunication.
- **Unified Command**: A "commander" AI oversees everything, coordinating members' actions. Like a battlefield general, preventing units from acting independently.

**Why it's useful**: A single AI, no matter how powerful, has limitations. Like one person, no matter how capable, can't simultaneously be a doctor, lawyer, and engineer. But a team, with each member specializing, can solve complex problems. The multi-agent system forms such an AI team.

**Inspiration from Su Yu's Combat Orders**: CZ proposes a fascinating cross-domain analogy—he studied military strategist Su Yu's methods for commanding large troop formations and found organizational logic applicable to AI collaboration. For example: Unify thinking before battle (align cognition), coordinate according to plan during battle (standardized processes), have reserves for contingencies (fault tolerance mechanisms). This is a classic case of applying centuries of human military wisdom to the AI field.

## Core Philosophies (Using Life Examples)

### "Embrace the Finite, Design the Infinite": Accept Imperfection to Create Perfection

**Simply put**: Acknowledge AI's limitations, then use clever methods to work around them.

**An analogy**: Asking a child to buy soy sauce. They might not find the store, miscalculate change, or forget to buy it. But you wouldn't stop them from helping—you'd tell them where the store is, give enough money, and provide a checklist. AI is similar; it's not omnipotent, but with the right methods, it can deliver maximum value.

**How to do it**:

- **Don't make AI do too many things at once**: Like you wouldn't have one employee handle sales, finance, HR, and R&D simultaneously. AI excels at focused tasks, not being a jack-of-all-trades. Break big tasks into small ones, each AI doing just one thing.
- **Set a budget for AI**: AI thinking costs money (Token consumption), like paying employees. Set a budget for AI to work within; don't let it think indefinitely.
- **Allow AI to be imperfect**: AI's first output might not be great; that's okay. Design a "check-feedback-revise" loop, giving AI a chance to improve. Like a manager giving feedback after assigning a task, not expecting perfection on the first try.

### "Deep Creation, Shallow Distribution": Craft Content Meticulously, but Present It Simply

**Simply put**: Think deeply and polish during creation, but lower barriers and simplify for distribution.

**An analogy**: Like cooking a dish. In the kitchen, you can fry, stir, boil, etc.—it's complex. But when serving guests, you just present a delicious, well-presented plate; guests don't need to know the entire cooking process. Creation is "deep processing"; distribution is "shallow presentation."

**How to do it**:

- **Spend more time creating**: Good content needs polishing. Like CZ's INSIGHTS articles in this repository—each is thoughtfully crafted, not hastily written.
- **Lower barriers during distribution**: If only experts can understand your writing, its reach is limited. Good creators should make their content both professional and accessible. Like a good teacher who explains complex knowledge simply.

### "Controllable Trust": Let Humans Confidently Delegate Tasks to AI

**Simply put**: Establish mechanisms so humans trust AI won't run amok and can intervene when needed.

**An analogy**: Like letting a new employee work independently, but not completely hands-off. You'd set workflows, conduct regular checks, and retain approval authority. The employee, knowing there's oversight, works more diligently; you, knowing there's a safety net, worry less.

**How to do it**:

- **Make AI explain what it's doing**: Don't let AI be a black box outputting results without explanation. Require AI to explain its reasoning process so humans can understand and review.
- **Retain human approval at key nodes**: Like major contracts needing a leader's signature, AI's final output needs human confirmation. This isn't distrust but responsibility.
- **Define AI's permission boundaries**: Clearly state what AI can and cannot do. Like setting limits for a new employee's authority to prevent overstepping.

### "Complexity is the Inevitable Path to Cognition": Don't Try to Take Shortcuts

**Simply put**: True understanding must go through complexity; shortcuts only keep you at the surface.

**An analogy**: Learning to swim. Reading books alone won't work. You must get in the water, swallow some, struggle a bit, to truly learn. Investing, programming, writing code are the same—there's a chasm between reading others' work and doing it yourself.

**How to do it**:

- **Allow yourself to experience complexity**: Don't believe "master a skill in 7 days" claims. Those are marketing slogans; real skills require time.
- **Start small**: Want to learn investing? Don't invest all your savings upfront. Start with a small amount, feel market fluctuations, and gain experience.
- **Learn from failure**: CZ's LOGS record many failures—AI programming failures, integration tool failures, translation task failures. These failures aren't shameful; they're valuable learning materials.

## Special Recommendation

If you can only read one article, we recommend [Returning to Basics: Complexity is the Inevitable Path to Cognition](../INSIGHTS/7.md). This is CZ's deep reflection on learning and growth, containing a brilliant quote:

> "I will not pay any price for the simplicity on this side of complexity, but I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity."

This means: The kind of "simplicity" claimed without experiencing complexity is worthless; true simplicity is wisdom distilled after experiencing complexity. Understanding this quote will give you new insights into learning, work, and life.

## What is This?

Imagine someone putting all their thoughts, projects, and learning notes in one place, like a public "brain backup." That's this repository—CZ's digital thinking space.

CZ is a practitioner in quantitative trading and fintech, and also someone who loves thinking and writing. He openly shares his research findings, project practices, investment thoughts, and technical explorations, forming this rich knowledge base.

This repository has three main parts:

**First, the INSIGHTS series articles.** These are CZ's core thoughts, covering his insights into AI-human collaboration, investment strategies, content creation, and more. These articles are not simple notes but systematic discussions born from deep consideration.

**Second, the LOGS series records.** These are summaries of CZ's daily work and life, like a continuously updated diary. From early January to early February 2026, there are almost daily entries, including what new tools he used, what pitfalls he encountered, and what new ideas he had. Reading these logs, you can feel how a real thinker works.

**Third, Projects & Tools.** CZ doesn't just think; he also acts. He puts his ideas into practice, developing projects like CZON (a content creation tool) and EA (a quantitative investment fund). These projects are not just concepts on paper but actual, runnable, usable tools.

The time span of this repository isn't long, about a month, but the content density is high. It shows how a professional continuously learns, produces, and iterates. Whether you want to learn about cutting-edge AI applications, study investment strategies, or simply see how a serious person thinks and works, this repository is worth a look.

## Core Projects (Explained by Analogy)

### CZON: Like Your Intelligent Writing Assistant

**One-sentence explanation**: A tool that lets you write in your native language and automatically translates it into multiple languages.

**What it does**:

- **Write natively, translate automatically**: It's like hiring a secretary fluent in multiple languages. You just write articles in Chinese, and the secretary translates them into English, Japanese, Spanish, etc. You don't worry about translation details; you focus on the content itself.
- **Automatically organize and publish**: After writing, CZON automatically generates web pages, optimizes for SEO, creates sitemaps, and handles everything needed for publishing. It's like having a thoughtful butler who takes care of everything so you can focus on creation.
- **Intelligent categorization and tagging**: You don't need to categorize articles yourself. CZON reads your content and automatically tags and classifies it. It's like having a librarian who knows you well—you hand them a book, and they know exactly which shelf it belongs on.

**Why it's useful**: For content creators, writing is tiring enough. Having to handle translation, formatting, and publishing is even more distracting. CZON's goal is to let you focus on creation and leave the rest to the tool. It's like switching from hand-washing clothes to using a washing machine—the clothes are the same, but you save a lot of time and effort.

**Especially noteworthy is the "N-shaped Potential Energy Curve"**: CZ proposes an interesting view—the lifecycle of content resembles the letter N. It starts as a low-potential spark of inspiration; after refinement, the content improves and potential rises; publishing requires adapting to different platforms, a "dimensional reduction" causing potential to dip; after publication, reader feedback causes potential to rise again. Understanding this curve helps you better plan your creative rhythm.

### EA Project: Like Opening a "Smart Bank"

**One-sentence explanation**: An intelligent financial management tool that helps you manage idle money for stable returns.

**What it does**:

- **Principal-protected investment**: Like a bank deposit, your principal is safe. This is thanks to a "senior/subordinated" structure—CZ and the team invest their own money to bear the risk, protecting investors' funds.
- **Floating returns**: The current annualized return is around 12%. It's like depositing money in a bank; the bank invests it, shares profits with you, and absorbs losses itself.
- **Withdraw anytime**: Unlike some financial products with lock-in periods, EA allows withdrawals at any time. Standard withdrawals arrive in 7 days; for urgent needs, a 0.5% fee enables instant access.

**Why it's useful**: For ordinary people who want their idle money to grow but don't want high risk, EA offers an option. You don't need to study candlestick charts, monitor markets, or worry about principal safety. Just put money in and check returns periodically. It's like entrusting money to a reliable steward who manages it so you don't have to worry.

**The backstory**: EA's predecessor was a private fund that started operating in March 2024, with over a year of live performance records. Cumulative return: +39.22%, annualized return ~22%, profitable months accounted for 95% (19 out of 20 months), maximum drawdown only 1.12%. These numbers show the team has real skill.

### Capital Persistence War Framework: Like Crafting a "Smart Gambling Strategy"

**One-sentence explanation**: A set of investment methodologies teaching you how to pursue large returns while controlling risk.

**What it does**:

- **Set loss limits**: Like deciding before a card game how much you're willing to lose. The Capital Persistence War requires you to define upfront: What's my maximum loss? At what point do I cut losses? This gives you peace of mind and prevents panic.
- **Continuous small investments**: Not going all-in at once, but investing a little daily (or weekly). It's like not betting a fortune at a casino but playing steadily at the table, staying in the game, waiting for good opportunities.
- **Add to winning positions**: Increase investment when making profits, letting profits run. It's like betting your winnings to win more. This goes against most people's intuition—many add to losing positions to average down but take profits quickly when winning.
- **Define victory conditions**: When is it a "win"? Not a vague "make money," but a clear numerical target. Like finishing a game level, you know what level you need to reach to win.

**Why it's useful**: Ordinary investors most commonly err by being either too conservative (only daring to save in banks) or too aggressive (borrowing to go all-in). The Capital Persistence War offers a middle, rational choice. It tells you: You can pursue large returns, but use a scientific, controlled method. It's not gambling on luck but on probability.

**A vivid analogy**: Imagine running on a track. On the left are the "steady growth" folks, moving at a constant, slow but steady pace. On the right are the "class-jumping" folks, trying to sprint but prone to falling. The Capital Persistence War is like a third path: You set a safety line (risk control line). Within it, you can sprint; if you cross it, you stop immediately. This method lets you pursue high returns without risking ruin.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration System: Like Forming an "AI Special Forces Team"

**One-sentence explanation**: A method for multiple AI agents to divide labor, collaborate, and complete complex tasks together.

**What it does**:

- **Division of labor and collaboration**: Like an army with scouts, communicators, snipers, and logistics personnel, each with a role. The multi-agent system has AIs with different roles: one for gathering information, one for analysis, one for execution, one for review.
- **Standardized communication**: How do different AIs communicate? Using a unified "protocol." Like an army with standard communication frequencies and codes, preventing miscommunication.
- **Unified command**: A "commander" AI coordinates overall actions, harmonizing team members. Like a battlefield general ensuring units don't act independently.

**Why it's useful**: Even the most powerful single AI has limitations. Like one person, no matter how capable, can't simultaneously be a doctor, lawyer, and engineer. But a team where each specializes can solve complex problems. A multi-agent system forms such an AI team.

**Inspiration from Su Yu's combat directives**: CZ proposes a fascinating cross-domain analogy—he studied military strategist Su Yu's methods for commanding large troop formations and found organizational logic applicable to AI collaboration. For example: Unify thinking before battle (align cognition), coordinate according to plan during battle (standardize processes), have reserves for contingencies (fault tolerance). This is a classic case of applying centuries of human military wisdom to the AI field.

## Core Philosophies (Using Life Examples)

### "Embrace Limits, Design Infinity": Accept Imperfection to Create Perfection

**Simply put**: Acknowledge AI's limitations, then use clever methods to work around them.

**An analogy**: Asking a child to buy soy sauce, they might not find the store, miscalculate change, or forget to buy it. But you wouldn't stop them from helping—you'd tell them where the store is, give enough money, write a checklist. AI is similar; it's not omnipotent, but with the right methods, it can deliver maximum value.

**How to do it**:

- **Don't make AI do too many things at once**: Like you wouldn't have one employee handle sales, finance, HR, and R&D simultaneously. AI excels at focused tasks, not being a jack-of-all-trades. Break big tasks into small ones, each AI doing just one thing.
- **Set a budget for AI**: AI thinking costs money (token consumption), like paying an employee's salary. Set a budget for AI to work within, preventing unlimited thinking.
- **Allow AI imperfection**: AI's first output might not be perfect; that's okay. Design a "check-feedback-revise" loop for AI to improve. Like a manager giving feedback after assigning a task, not expecting perfection on the first try.

### "Deep Creation, Shallow Distribution": Craft Content Meticulously, But Present It Simply

**Simply put**: Think deeply and polish during creation, but lower barriers and simplify for distribution.

**An analogy**: Like cooking a dish—the process in the kitchen can be complex with frying, stir-frying, boiling, etc. But when serving guests, you present a delicious, well-presented plate; guests don't need to know the entire cooking process. Creation is "deep processing"; distribution is "shallow presentation."

**How to do it**:

- **Spend more time creating**: Good content needs polishing. Like CZ's INSIGHTS articles in this repository—each is thoughtfully crafted, not hastily written.
- **Lower barriers during distribution**: If only experts can understand your writing, its reach is limited. Good creators make content both professional and accessible. Like a good teacher explaining complex knowledge simply.

### "Controlled Trust": Let Humans Confidently Delegate Tasks to AI

**Simply put**: Establish mechanisms so humans trust AI won't act recklessly and can intervene when needed.

**An analogy**: Like letting a new employee work independently but not completely hands-off. You set workflows, conduct regular checks, retain approval authority. The employee knows there's oversight and works more diligently; you know there's a safety net and worry less.

**How to do it**:

- **Make AI explain what it's doing**: Don't let AI be a black box outputting results without revealing the process. Require AI to explain its reasoning so humans can understand and review.
- **Retain human approval at key stages**: Like major contracts needing a leader's signature, AI's final output needs human confirmation. This isn't distrust but responsibility.
- **Set AI's permission boundaries**: Clearly define what AI can and cannot do. Like limiting a new employee's authority to prevent overstepping.

### "Complexity is the Inevitable Path to Cognition": Don't Try to Take Shortcuts

**Simply put**: True understanding must go through complexity; shortcuts keep you at the surface.

**An analogy**: Learning to swim—reading books alone won't work. You must get in the water, swallow some, struggle a bit, to truly learn. Investing, programming, coding are the same—there's a chasm between reading others' work and doing it yourself.

**How to do it**:

- **Allow yourself to experience complexity**: Don't believe "master a skill in 7 days" claims. Those are marketing slogans; real skills need time to accumulate.
- **Start small**: Want to learn investing? Don't invest all your savings upfront. Start with a small amount, feel market fluctuations, gain experience.
- **Learn from failure**: CZ's LOGS record many failures—AI programming failures, tool integration failures, translation task failures. These failures aren't shameful but valuable learning material.

## What is This?

Imagine someone putting all their thoughts, projects, and learning notes in one place, like a public "brain backup." That's this repository—CZ's digital thinking space.

CZ is a practitioner in quantitative trading and fintech, and also someone who loves thinking and writing. He openly shares his research findings, project practices, investment thoughts, and technical explorations, forming this rich knowledge base.

This repository has three main parts:

**First, the INSIGHTS series articles.** These represent CZ's core thinking, covering his insights into AI-human collaboration, investment strategies, content creation, and more. These articles are not simple notes but systematic discourses born from deep contemplation.

**Second, the LOGS series records.** These are summaries of CZ's daily work and life, like a continuously updated diary. From early January to early February 2026, there are records almost every day, including what new tools he used, what pitfalls he encountered, and what new ideas he had. Reading these logs, you can feel how a genuine thinker works.

**Third, Projects & Tools.** CZ doesn't just think; he also acts. He implements his ideas, developing projects like CZON (a content creation tool) and EA (a quantitative investment fund). These projects are not just concepts on paper but are actual, runnable, usable tools.

The repository's time span isn't long, about a month, but the content density is high. It showcases how a professional continuously learns, produces, and iterates. Whether you want to understand cutting-edge AI applications, learn investment strategies, or simply see how a serious person thinks and works, this repository is worth a look.

## Core Projects (Explained by Analogy)

### CZON: Like Your Intelligent Writing Assistant

**One-sentence explanation**: A tool that lets you write in your native language and automatically translates it into multiple languages.

**What it can do**:

- **Write natively, translate automatically**: It's like hiring a secretary fluent in multiple languages. You just write articles in Chinese, and the secretary translates them into English, Japanese, Spanish, etc. You don't worry about translation details; you focus on the content itself.
- **Automatically organize and publish**: After writing, CZON automatically generates web pages, optimizes for SEO, creates sitemaps, and handles everything needed for publishing. It's like having a thoughtful butler; you just create, and it takes care of the rest.
- **Intelligent categorization and tagging**: You don't need to categorize articles yourself. CZON reads your content and automatically tags and classifies it. It's like having a librarian who knows you well; you hand them a book, and they know exactly which shelf it belongs on.

**Why it's useful**: For content creators, writing is tiring enough. Having to handle translation, formatting, and publishing on top of that is distracting. CZON's goal is to let you focus on creation and leave the rest to the tool. It's like switching from hand-washing clothes to using a washing machine—the clothes are the same, but you save a lot of time and effort.

**Especially noteworthy is the "N-shaped Energy Curve"**: CZ proposes an interesting viewpoint—the lifecycle of content resembles the English letter 'N'. Initially, it's just an inspiration with low potential energy; after refinement, the content improves, and potential energy rises; during publishing, it needs to adapt to different platforms, requiring a "dimensional reduction," so potential energy falls; after publication, receiving reader feedback causes potential energy to rise again. Understanding this curve helps you better plan your creative rhythm.

### EA Project: Like Opening a "Smart Bank"

**One-sentence explanation**: An intelligent financial management tool that helps you manage idle money for stable returns.

**What it can do**:

- **Principal-protected investment**: Like a bank deposit, your principal is safe. This is thanks to a structure called "priority/subordinated"—CZ and the team put their own money at risk to protect investors' funds.
- **Floating returns**: The current annualized return is around 12%. It's like depositing money in a bank; the bank invests your money, shares some profit with you if it makes money, and bears the loss itself if it loses.
- **Withdraw anytime**: Unlike some financial products with lock-in periods, EA allows you to redeem at any time. Standard redemptions arrive in 7 days; for urgent needs, you can get instant access by paying a 0.5% fee.

**Why it's useful**: For ordinary people who want their idle money to earn some returns but don't want to take high risks, EA provides an option. You don't need to study candlestick charts, monitor the market, or worry about principal safety. You just put money in and periodically check the returns. It's like handing your money to a reliable steward; you don't worry, and they manage it for you.

**The backstory**: EA's predecessor was a private fund that started operating in March 2024, with over a year of live trading performance records. Cumulative return: +39.22%, annualized return: ~22%, profitable months accounted for 95% (19 out of 20 months were profitable), maximum drawdown only 1.12%. These numbers show this team has real skill.

### Capital Protracted Warfare Framework: Like Formulating a "Smart Gambling Strategy"

**One-sentence explanation**: A set of investment methodologies teaching you how to pursue large returns while keeping risks under control.

**What it can do**:

- **Set a loss bottom line**: Like deciding before playing cards how much you're willing to lose at most. Capital Protracted Warfare requires you to clarify before entering: What's my maximum loss? At what point do I stop loss? This gives you peace of mind and prevents panic.
- **Continuous small investments**: Not going all-in at once, but investing a little every day (or week). It's like you're not betting a fortune at a casino but playing steadily at the table, staying in the game, waiting for good opportunities.
- **Pyramid on floating profits**: Increase investment when making money, letting profits run. It's like when you win a bet, you keep betting the winnings to try to win more. This is counterintuitive to most people—most people want to average down when losing and take profits quickly when winning.
- **Define victory conditions**: When is it considered a "win"? Not a vague "make money," but a clear numerical target. Like finishing a game level, you know what level you need to reach to win.

**Why it's useful**: The most common mistake ordinary people make in investing is being either too conservative (only daring to save in banks) or too aggressive (borrowing to go all-in). Capital Protracted Warfare offers a middle, rational choice. It tells you: You can pursue large returns, but use a scientific, controlled method. Don't gamble on luck; gamble on probability.

**A vivid analogy**: Imagine running on a track. On the left are the "steady growth" folks, moving at a constant pace—slow but steady. On the right are the "class-jumping" folks, trying to sprint but prone to falling. Capital Protracted Warfare is like a third path: You set a safety line (risk control line). Within that line, you can accelerate and sprint. If you run outside the safety line, you stop immediately. This method lets you pursue high returns without risking total ruin.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration System: Like Forming an "AI Special Forces Team"

**One-sentence explanation**: A method for making multiple AI robots divide labor, collaborate, and complete complex tasks together.

**What it can do**:

- **Division of labor and collaboration**: Like an army having scouts, signalers, snipers, and logistics personnel, each with their role. The multi-agent system also has AIs with different roles: one for gathering information, one for analysis, one for execution, one for review.
- **Standardized communication**: How do different AIs communicate? Using a unified "protocol." Like an army having standard communication frequencies and passwords, avoiding miscommunication.
- **Unified command**: There's a "commander" AI overseeing the overall situation, coordinating the actions of each member. Like a general on the battlefield, not letting units fight independently.

**Why it's useful**: No single AI, no matter how powerful, can do everything. Like one person, no matter how capable, can't simultaneously be a doctor, lawyer, and engineer. But with a team where each specializes, complex problems can be solved. The multi-agent system is about forming such an AI team.

**Inspiration from Su Yu's combat directives**: CZ proposes a fascinating cross-domain analogy—he studied military strategist Su Yu's methods for commanding large corps in battle and found the organizational logic could be transferred to AI collaboration. For example: Unify thinking before battle (align cognition), coordinate according to plan during battle (standardize processes), have reserves for unexpected situations (fault tolerance mechanisms). This is a classic case of applying centuries of human military wisdom to the AI field.

## Core Concepts (Using Life Examples)

### "Embrace Limitations, Design Infinity": Accept Imperfection to Create Perfection

**Simply put**: Acknowledge AI's limitations, then use clever methods to work around them.

**An analogy**: You ask a child to buy soy sauce. They might not find the store, miscalculate the money, or forget to buy it. But you wouldn't stop the child from doing tasks—you'd tell them where the store is, give them enough change, write a checklist for them to tick. AI is the same; it's not omnipotent, but you can use the right methods to maximize its value.

**How to do it specifically**:

- **Don't make AI do too many things at once**: Like you wouldn't have one employee handle sales, finance, HR, and R&D simultaneously. AI excels at single-point breakthroughs, not being a jack-of-all-trades. Break big tasks into small ones, each AI doing just one thing.
- **Set a budget for AI**: AI thinking costs money (Token consumption), like paying employees. Set a budget, let AI work within it, don't let it think indefinitely.
- **Allow AI to be imperfect**: AI's first generated content might not be great; that's okay. Design a "check-feedback-revise" loop, giving AI a chance to improve. Like a leader gives feedback after assigning a task, not expecting perfection on the first try.

### "Create Deeply, Distribute Simply": Good Content Needs Careful Crafting, but Presentation Should Be Easy to Understand

**Simply put**: Spend time thinking and polishing during creation; lower the barrier and make it easy to understand during distribution.

**An analogy**: Like cooking a dish. In the kitchen, you can fry, stir-fry, boil, and braze—it's complex. But when serving guests, you just present a delicious, well-presented plate; guests don't need to know the entire cooking process. Creation is "deep processing"; distribution is "simple presentation."

**How to do it specifically**:

- **Spend more time creating**: Good content needs polishing. Like CZ's INSIGHTS articles in this repository—each isn't written casually but after deep thought.
- **Lower the barrier during distribution**: If what you write is only understandable by experts, its reach is limited. Good creators should make their content both professional and easy to understand. Like a good teacher who can explain complex knowledge simply.

### "Controlled Trust": Let Humans Confidently Delegate Tasks to AI

**Simply put**: Establish mechanisms so humans trust AI won't run amok and can intervene when needed.

**An analogy**: Like letting a new employee work independently, but you don't completely let go. You set workflows, conduct regular checks, retain approval authority. The new employee knows there's supervision and works more diligently; you know there's insurance and worry less.

**How to do it specifically**:

- **Make AI explain what it's doing**: Don't let AI be a black box outputting results without showing the process. Require AI to explain its reasoning so humans can understand and review.
- **Retain human approval rights at key nodes**: Like major contracts need a leader's signature, AI-generated final results also need human confirmation. This isn't distrust; it's responsibility.
- **Set AI's permission boundaries**: Clearly define what AI can and cannot do. Like setting limits on a new employee's work permissions to prevent overstepping.

### "Complexity is the Inevitable Path to Cognition": Don't Try to Take Shortcuts

**Simply put**: True understanding must go through a complex process; taking shortcuts only leaves you at the surface.

**An analogy**: Learning to swim—you can't learn just by reading books. You must get in the water, swallow some water, struggle a few times to truly learn. It's the same with investing, programming, writing code—there's a chasm between reading what others write and doing it yourself.

**How to do it specifically**:

- **Allow yourself to experience complexity**: Don't believe "master a skill in 7 days" claims. Those are marketing slogans; real skills take time to accumulate.
- **Start small**: Want to learn investing? Don't start by investing all your savings. Try with a small amount first, feel market fluctuations, gain experience.
- **Learn from failure**: CZ records many failures in his LOGS—AI programming failures, integration tool failures, translation task failures. These failures aren't shameful; they're valuable learning materials.

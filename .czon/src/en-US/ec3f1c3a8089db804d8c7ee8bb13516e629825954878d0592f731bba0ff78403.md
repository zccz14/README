## Key Insights

Different platforms have different "languages": Twitter needs hooks, LinkedIn needs professionalism, Xiaohongshu needs approachability.

Summaries are also a content strategy: A good summary can increase click-through rates by over 30%.

Automation frees up creative time: Authors no longer need to manually rewrite copy for each platform.

Most practical advice: Start by implementing SEO summaries and list preview summaries, as these are essential for any blog/website. Social media summaries can be added in a second phase, since user preferences for social channels vary widely.

With this design, CZON not only helps users translate content but also helps them package and distribute it, creating a more complete value loop.

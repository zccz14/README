## Key Insights

Different platforms have different "languages": Twitter needs hooks, LinkedIn needs professionalism, Xiaohongshu needs approachability.

Summaries are also content strategy: Good summaries can increase click-through rates by over 30%.

Automation frees up creative time: Authors no longer need to manually rewrite copy for each platform.

Most practical recommendation: Implement SEO summaries and list-preview summaries first, as these are essential for any blog/website. Social media summaries can be prioritized in the second phase, as user preferences for social channels vary greatly.

With this design, CZON not only helps users translate content but also helps them package and distribute it, creating a more complete value loop.

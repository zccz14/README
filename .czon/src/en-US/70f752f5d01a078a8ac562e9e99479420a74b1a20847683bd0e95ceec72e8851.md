# The Protracted War of Capital (Draft)

2026-01-17

As individual investors, our purpose in surviving and thriving in the market is to achieve sustained wealth growth, ultimately aiming to transcend class barriers. We often yearn to discover a method for stable profitability to achieve success, or fantasize about seizing an opportunity for overnight riches. Both avenues are often elusive; the former because market competition is fierce and strategies can never guarantee long-term victory, the latter because the risks are excessively high and often require heavy bets. There are many voices, such as the "Individual Inevitable Defeat Theory" that claims one can never beat the market and investing is destined to lose money, the "Steady Development Theory" that insists wealth accumulation must rely on time, and the "All-In for Instant Wealth Theory" advocating gambling for a chance to turn a bicycle into a motorcycle. These are all erroneous viewpoints. You can always see people making fortunes overnight in the market, and also see many going bankrupt. Consequently, many simplistically attribute the outcome to either ability or luck.

I wish to propose a new perspective on the survival and development strategy for individual investors in the market. **I believe that waging a protracted war is the only viable path for individual investors to transcend class barriers.** Superficially, the term "protracted war" doesn't sound like a strategy welcomed by individual investors. It seems to suggest enduring, sacrificing, disregarding short-term gains and losses, and incurring significant time costs—something quite contrary to human nature. It demands a person to toil diligently day after day for years in the market, enduring its multifaceted assaults.

To solidify our stance, clarify the fundamentals, and distinguish it from other viewpoints, I will refute the three common erroneous views in the market one by one:

### **Refuting the Individual Inevitable Defeat Theory (Cynicism)**

Many believe that individual investors can never beat the market and are destined to lose money.

Their reasons generally boil down to 4 points:

1.  Individuals' limited information is at a disadvantage compared to the market's complete information.
2.  Individuals' limited capital is at a disadvantage compared to the market's infinite capital.
3.  Individuals' limited knowledge is at a disadvantage compared to professional teams or institutions.
4.  The market contains fixed "drainage" mechanisms, such as transaction fees, taxes, etc., which erode profit margins.

This view overlooks the learning capacity and adaptability of individual investors. The market is a game-theoretic system; the roles of "harvester" and "harvested" are dynamically changing and exist in a symbiotic ecological relationship. If the harvested disappear, the harvesters lose their foundation for existence. Moreover, this ecology forms a cycle, creating a dynamic equilibrium in a triangular game. Often, choosing one's ecological niche is key to an individual investor's success, not whether one can gain an absolute advantage. Proponents of the Individual Inevitable Defeat Theory view the market too narrowly, ignoring its complexity and dynamism. **This is a typical mindset of rejecting an entire entity upon seeing its flaws.**

Proponents of this view also typically believe that the ultimate winners are always the large institutions and professional teams. However, professional teams also started as individual investors. Through continuous learning and adaptation to the market, they eventually grew into professional teams. Institutions and individuals differ merely in form, scale, resources, and stage of development, not in essence. Individual investors can absolutely, through a protracted war, gradually accumulate experience and capital, ultimately achieving the goal of class transcendence.

There is also a subtle variation of this view: the belief that a winner-takes-all scenario might eventually emerge, where individual investors can never survive in the market and will be entirely eliminated. If this were truly the case, the harvesters would lose their foundation, and the market ecology could not be sustained. Therefore, this viewpoint is also untenable.

Furthermore, this is a **cynical** viewpoint, attempting to evade the market's realities by negating the capabilities of individual investors. Does abstaining from the market truly allow individual investors to avoid being harvested? This is merely an ostrich mentality. The economy has long engulfed everyone. In today's world, most currencies are pegged to the US dollar, whose value is closely tied to US Treasury bonds, which fund US development. Many people accumulate wealth but dare not invest in the market, only to find their wealth constantly shrinking due to inflation, ultimately becoming the harvested. In the future, even if the US falters, another country will take up the baton and continue issuing the global reserve currency. This is unavoidable because the essence of wealth is control over resources. Wealth that cannot be exchanged for resources from others is ultimately illusory.

**The entire world is already "interlinked by iron chains."**

**While individual investors are at a disadvantage in some aspects, they also possess unique advantages, such as independence, adaptability, flexibility, and liquidity.**

*   **Independence:** Allows individual investors to focus solely on their own investment strategies and goals without needing to compromise with anyone else. Institutions often must consider the interests of shareholders, clients, etc., complicating decision-making.
*   **Adaptability:** Individual investors can at least choose not to participate in certain markets and can choose to learn and adapt to market changes, unbound by restrictions. Institutions often need to maintain established business models, making rapid adjustments difficult.
*   **Flexibility:** Enables individual investors to quickly adjust strategies to adapt to market changes without going through cumbersome approval processes. Institutions often require multi-level approvals, leading to slow responses.
*   **Liquidity:** Individual investors can enter and exit markets almost without restriction, choosing different investment instruments and markets. Institutions are often constrained by capital size and regulatory requirements.

If individual investors can fully leverage these advantages and continuously learn and adapt to the market, they are entirely capable of achieving success in the market. In the AI era, individual investors can use AI tools to quickly compensate for their disadvantages, such as acquiring information, analyzing data, **writing code for trading strategies**, etc., thereby enhancing their strengths. Particularly, writing code for trading strategies—as will be mentioned later—programmatic trading at the execution level is key to waging a protracted war. Even if an individual investor cannot code, they can use AI to assist in writing code to achieve programmatic trading, which is already a proven feasible solution.

### **Refuting the All-In for Instant Wealth Theory (Opportunism)**

On the other hand, a minority in the market advocate the "gamble to turn a bicycle into a motorcycle" strategy, believing that a one-time, high-risk investment can achieve rapid wealth growth. This strategy seems to solve the time problem of personal wealth growth but actually overlooks the importance of risk management. Those who hold and act on this view are either novices uninitiated by the market or desperate gamblers with little left to lose. They often believe their luck can overcome market risks, but reality is often different.

All-in investments often come with enormous risks. Once they fail, they can lead to severe personal wealth loss or even bankruptcy. Moreover, market opportunities are not available to everyone, and the probability of success is often very low. Therefore, relying solely on an all-in investment strategy cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. Currently, in the MEME market, there are many myths of instant wealth, with stories of overnight thousand-fold or ten-thousand-fold gains emerging constantly, attracting a flood of speculators. However, these stories often ignore the underlying risks and cases of failure, leading many speculators chasing the dream of instant wealth to ultimately end up bankrupt.

Some people appear to go all-in, but the actual capital they invest each time is not their entire wealth, but all the capital they have on the "gambling table." Even if they lose, they have reserves. These individuals are not the proponents of the All-In for Instant Wealth Theory we are discussing. However, under certain conditions, such individuals can also become true all-in investors, for example, when the capital on their "table" approaches their total wealth. Those accustomed to all-in investing become increasingly likely to turn into true all-in investors.

Comparatively, most people understand this principle. But when opportunities arise, they are often too quickly overwhelmed by the desire for instant wealth, transforming into all-in investors. This is the most common mistake individual investors make during the future strategic stalemate phase. It is necessary to build psychological resilience in advance to prevent losing rationality and making wrong decisions when opportunities come.

This is both a crisis and an opportunity. **The more people advocate all-in for instant wealth, the more it indicates the existence of huge volatility and immense opportunities in the market. The more enthusiastic people are about gambling, the more they can perceive the existence of high-volatility markets.** Individual investors need to清醒地认识到 (clearly recognize) that all-in investment strategies cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. However, if one can适度地利用 (moderately utilize) all-in strategies under controllable risk, then individual investors are entirely capable of achieving rapid wealth growth in the market.

### **Refuting the Steady Development Theory (Dogmatism)**

The last, and most classic, viewpoint. I criticize it as representative of **dogmatism**. It presents seemingly reasonable arguments to prove that personal wealth growth must rely on steady development strategies. However, this view overlooks the time constraint issue of personal wealth growth. There are also many popular aphorisms, such as "be a friend of time," "the magic of compound interest," etc., which all sound very reasonable.

Historically,破除教条主义 (dismantling dogmatism) has always been difficult because it often wears the cloak of rationality, making it hard to discern its true nature.

A living legend—Warren Buffett, the pioneer of value investing—is the greatest representative of this viewpoint. He advocates achieving steady annual growth of around 20% by holding quality assets long-term. This view is indeed applicable to a certain extent for institutional investors and most individual investors. However, it does not resolve **the fundamental contradiction in the issue of personal wealth class transcendence—the conflict between the finite nature of an individual's lifespan and the time required to accumulate wealth.**

In this world, many people live as long as Buffett, but there is only one "Oracle of Omaha." Many know and practice value investing. If everyone could develop smoothly如同“熬资历”一般 (as if "serving time for seniority"), where would the extra money come from? If you can accumulate wealth through time, your predecessors could do so even more. Every individual investor should genuinely ponder whether they have overlooked some blind spot. In this world, are there invisible barriers hindering wealth growth? If so, what are they? If not, why can't most people achieve leapfrog wealth growth?

The fundamental dilemma faced by individual investors is:

1.  Wanting steady growth, but the steadily growing wealth cannot keep up with逐年增加的生活开支 (annually increasing living expenses). One cannot accumulate wealth without eating or drinking.
2.  Wanting to increase savings, but总会被突如其来的风险事件打断积累计划 (accumulation plans are always interrupted by sudden risk events), be it unemployment, illness, or family变故 (changes).
3.  Wanting to苟住发展 (lie low and develop), but social pressures催促着必须提升生活质量 (urge the need to improve quality of life)—buying houses and cars, getting married and having children, maintaining面子工程 (face-saving projects), etc.
4.  Wanting to搏一搏 (take a gamble), but fearing the loss of existing积累 (accumulations) and being unable to承受大起大落的风险 (withstand the risks of dramatic fluctuations).

The market has many theories teaching how to achieve steady wealth growth, how to avoid risks, and how to earn a 10-30% annual return.
Such strategies include but are not limited to:

*   **Value Investing:** Selecting undervalued quality assets, holding them long-term, and waiting for the market to correct their prices.
*   **Risk Parity & Permanent Portfolio:** Diversifying investments across different asset classes and定期再平衡 (periodically rebalancing) to降低整体投资组合的风险 (reduce overall portfolio risk).
*   **Index Investing:** Investing in market indices to obtain the market's average return, avoiding individual stock risk, and同步增长 (growing in sync) with the broader national economic environment.

If so, by the time assets increase tenfold, it will be ten years later, life will have entered the next stage, and as life stabilizes, the significance of wealth growth diminishes. If an individual relies solely on steady development strategies to achieve wealth growth, it is likely that they will not achieve leapfrog wealth growth before the end of their lifespan. Moreover, if wealth does not arrive when it is most needed, does pursuing leapfrog wealth growth still hold great significance in old age? Isn't having enough sufficient?

Some may幻想 (fantasize) about achieving wealth growth for后代 (future generations) through inheritance,以此作为自身的意义 (using this as their own meaning). However, "崽卖爷田不心疼" (children selling ancestral land don't feel the pain)—this thinking is very unrealistic. Each generation has its own奋斗目标和生活方式 (struggle goals and lifestyle). Future generations may not cherish the wealth积累 (accumulations) of their predecessors and might even squander them. Therefore, leaving wealth to the next generation is not necessarily meaningful. Inheritance is meaningful only when both wealth and思想 (ideology) are passed down.甚至思想的传承更为重要 (In fact, the传承 of ideology is more important), it is the main thing.

The scenario for steady development is completely different from that of ordinary people. **I emphasize that I am驳斥 (refuting) those dogmatic viewpoints that advocate steady development under any circumstances.** Refuting the Steady Development Theory may sound heretical, but in reality, for individual investors, it is not a pragmatic choice. Individual investors need to清醒地认识到 (clearly recognize) that the time for wealth growth is limited, and steady development strategies often cannot achieve leapfrog wealth growth within that limited time. Therefore, individual investors need to find a strategy that can achieve wealth growth within a relatively short period, not merely rely on steady development strategies.

Of course,矛盾会发生转换 (contradictions transform)—when personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development strategies become more important because the wealth is then sufficient to support personal living needs. Steady development strategies can help individuals maintain stable wealth growth and avoid losses due to market volatility. Furthermore, as a foundation for the next round of wealth growth, steady development strategies can provide individuals with a base area, preparing for another battle to transcend class barriers.

However, before personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development strategies are not the best choice for individual investors to achieve wealth growth. Individual investors need to find a strategy that can achieve wealth growth within a relatively short period, not merely rely on steady development strategies.

## The Protracted War of Capital

When I speak of a protracted war, I do not mean a war of duration in time, but achieving leapfrog wealth growth through a publicly verifiable strategy. It consists of several components:

1.  Learning to correctly analyze敌我矛盾和形势 (contradictions and situations between oneself and the opponent/market) to formulate correct strategic guidelines.
2.  Preparing a stable cash flow input to **control the maximum rate of loss**, thereby achieving survival in a弱势 (disadvantaged position).
3.  Learning to maintain and accumulate advantages, avoiding unnecessary time消耗 (consumption) on monitoring screens, thereby achieving持续扩大 (continuous expansion) of advantages.
4.  Learning to乘胜追击 (exploit victories),决战决胜 (decisively engage and win) at opportune moments, not missing historical opportunity windows.
5.  Establishing psychological expectations, **accepting the possibility of大不了白干一场 (at worst, ending up with nothing gained)**, thereby avoiding psychological崩溃 (breakdown) due to failure.

It sounds complex, but the practical implementation is simple.

1.  **A cash flow input must be prepared.** Use time cost to换取 (exchange for) information and experience advantages. There must be a controllable, continuously investable cash flow. This can be salary income or stable interest income. This cash flow doesn't need to be large, but it must be stable. With this cash flow, one can continuously make small investments in the market, accumulating information and experience advantages.
2.  **Programmatic trading methods must be used** for底层投资操作 (underlying investment operations), avoiding any emotional or humanly impossible decisions, and preventing纪律性的问题 (disciplinary issues) at the execution stage. Moreover, programmatic trading can save the individual investor's energy and reduce psychological pressure from懊悔 (regret) over exiting to保本 (break even). Do not追求 (pursue) a fully automated system, but追求 (pursue) an imperfect yet profitable system that saves worry. **Investors must focus their energy on程序策略的设计和优化上 (designing and optimizing program strategies).** If you cannot code, let AI help. Do not盯盘 (monitor the market screen), do not纠结于 (agonize over) whether to buy or sell in each trade. This does not liberate you; it tortures you. This is the key to what I call advantage accumulation and avoiding unnecessary消耗 (consumption).
3.  **Profits must be immediately used to加仓 (scale up positions).** When capital is deployed in the correct direction, profits will quickly appear. Utilize the浮盈加仓策略 (profit-based scaling strategy) to continuously扩大优势 (amplify advantages). Note: There is a very strict stop-loss condition here: if losses reach the level before scaling, one must stop loss. This is because market volatility clusters; tailwinds and headwinds often gather. If one can抓住 (seize) the opportunity of clustered tailwinds, then the浮盈加仓策略 (profit-based scaling strategy) can be used to continuously扩大优势 (amplify advantages). Scaling up means your cost basis rises, and the space between the cost basis and the current net value line constitutes a安全缓冲区 (safety buffer). When the buffer shrinks, if the current "speed" is still too high, the program should trigger减仓 (position reduction) to prevent被穿仓 (being wiped out).

This endeavor ultimately has two outcomes: either successfully achieving leapfrog wealth growth, or failing with limited losses.
Regardless of the outcome, the individual investor can accept it坦然 (calmly), learning and growing from the experience.

**Correctly Understanding Margin and Leverage**

A practical question: If one sets aside 6000 yuan per month, equivalent to only about 200 yuan per day for investment, what can that buy? Almost nothing.

This misunderstands the concept of cash flow; it is meant to填补亏损 (cover losses). For example, if buying one lot requires 10,000 yuan, your 200 yuan daily cash flow means you can accept a 2% daily loss rate, which is actually not insignificant. If the loss exceeds this rate, you need to主动退出市场 (actively exit the market) to prevent excessive losses.

This differs from another investment style: saving tens of thousands over several months, investing it all at once, setting no stop-loss,不敢认输 (daring not admit defeat) when losing, watching one's底线 (bottom line) being摩擦 (ground) by the market; when profiting,拼命加仓 (frantically scaling up),生怕赶不上发财的机会 (fearing missing the发财 opportunity),结果把自己架在山顶 (ending up stranded at the peak),活脱脱成了山顶资本 (becoming peak capital). This is a state of完全失控 (complete失控), lamentable.

Determining position size based on potential loss is a fundamental capital management concept. For this,学好小学数学 (learning elementary math well) and correctly solving word problems is necessary.

**Difference from "Heavy Betting on Spotted Opportunities"**

The difference from "heavy betting on spotted opportunities" is that it doesn't require spotting opportunities. Instead, it lets the market automatically筛选出正确的机会 (filter out correct opportunities), i.e., opportunities that can持续扩大盈利 (continuously expand profits). When the market reverses, the stop-loss is set at the loss level before scaling, thereby controlling losses within a manageable range.

**Is It Possible to Lose Forever?**

Yes. This is because the strategy itself fails to process market conditions into opportunities that can generate profits for a sufficiently long duration. For example, if this strategy can achieve 16 consecutive wins, it means the strategy can find enough clustered tailwind opportunities in the market to achieve leapfrog wealth growth. If the strategy can only achieve 4 consecutive wins, it might not achieve leapfrog wealth growth.

However, even if losses occur forever, they are within a controllable range. Individual investors can continuously adjust and optimize strategies, eventually finding one that achieves leapfrog wealth growth. Moreover, there might be a market cycle恰好适合 (恰好适合) this strategy, allowing it enough consecutive wins to achieve leapfrog wealth growth.

**When Can Victory Be Declared?**

When the current market liquidity is insufficient to support large-scale capital投入 (投入), victory for that局部策略 (localized strategy) can be declared. At this point, individual investors can choose to兑现 (realize) profits or转移资金 (transfer funds) to other markets in search of new opportunities. If, by then, the individual investor has already achieved leapfrog wealth growth, they can choose to退出市场 (exit the market) and enjoy the成果 (fruits).

**Relationship with Steady Growth?**

After achieving leapfrog wealth growth, individual investors can choose to转移部分资金 (transfer部分资金) to steady growth strategies to maintain stable wealth growth. Steady growth strategies can help individual investors avoid wealth losses due to market volatility, thereby achieving long-term stable wealth growth. Steady growth strategies can serve as the foundation for the next phase of wealth growth, providing individuals with a base area, preparing for another battle to transcend class barriers.

## Summary

The key takeaways are:

1.  Start with cash flow, control the loss rate to achieve survival in a弱势 (disadvantaged position).
2.  Use programmatic trading to avoid emotional decisions and achieve持续扩大 (continuous expansion) of advantages.
3.  Utilize浮盈加仓 (profit-based scaling) to乘胜追击 (exploit victories), achieving leapfrog wealth growth. Even if it fails, the loss equals the loss before scaling,不会击穿现金流 (not breaching the cash flow).

The specific programmatic strategy is the decisive key. How to generate this strategy cannot be fully explained in one article;后续会有专门的文章进行分享 (subsequent articles will专门分享).

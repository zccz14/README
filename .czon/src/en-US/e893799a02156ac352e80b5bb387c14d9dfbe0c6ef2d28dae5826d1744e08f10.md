# The Protracted War of Capital (Draft)

Modified on 2026-01-20, first draft on 2026-01-17.

**How to achieve class transcendence through capital investment?**

As individual investors, the purpose of surviving and developing in the market is to achieve sustained wealth growth, ultimately reaching the goal of class transcendence.

We always yearn to discover a method for stable profitability to achieve success, or fantasize about seizing an opportunity to become rich overnight. Both of these opportunities are often difficult to realize. The former because market competition is fierce and strategies can never win forever; the latter because the risks are too high and often require heavy bets. There are many voices, such as the "Individual Inevitable Defeat" theory that one can never beat the market and investing is doomed to lose money, the "All-in for Sudden Wealth" theory of betting it all for a chance, and the "Steady Development" theory that wealth accumulation must rely on time. These are all erroneous views that fail to solve the initially posed problem. You can always see people getting rich overnight in the market, and many others going bankrupt, with some spending their entire lives fluctuating within it. Therefore, many people simplistically attribute the problem to ability or luck.

This is essentially a problem with how the issue is defined. The market has never clearly defined what the standard for "success" is. If an investor always only looks at "annualized return," "maximum drawdown," "profit-loss ratio," or "Sharpe ratio," they have never defined what the endpoint of investing is. If a return target is met this year, what about next year? When can the battle end? When can victory be declared? Fighting a war where victory can never be defined is destined to be impossible to win.

I wish to propose a new perspective on the survival and development strategy for individual investors in the market. **I believe that waging a protracted war is the only way for individual investors to transcend class.** Briefly, a protracted war refers to a strategic combination of **controllable losses, cumulative advantage, and pressing the advantage**. It is not a protracted war in the temporal sense, but rather achieving leapfrog wealth growth through a publicly available strategy.

1.  **No-Risk Principle**: Control the maximum speed of losses to ensure survival capability during weakness.
2.  **No-Waste Principle**: Trade time for advantage. Use systematic trading to avoid emotional decisions and achieve continuous expansion of advantage.
3.  **No-Delay Principle**: Utilize profit-based position sizing to press the advantage, not wasting time, to achieve leapfrog wealth growth.
4.  **No-Ambiguity Principle**: Clearly define strategic objectives and victory conditions before committing, avoiding ambiguous strategic confusion.

I firmly oppose any strategic outcome that "permanently traps individuals in the market." This is an enormous waste of human life and social resources.

To solidify this stance, clarify the source, and differentiate from other viewpoints, I will refute the three common erroneous views in the market one by one:

### **Refuting the "Individual Inevitable Defeat" Theory (Cynicism)**

Many believe that individual investors can never beat the market and are doomed to lose money.

Their reasons roughly fall into 4 points:

1.  Individuals' limited information is at a disadvantage compared to the market's complete information.
2.  Individuals' limited capital is at a disadvantage compared to the market's infinite capital.
3.  Individuals' limited knowledge is at a disadvantage compared to professional teams or institutions.
4.  There are fixed extraction mechanisms in the market, such as transaction fees, taxes, etc., which erode profit margins.

This view overlooks the learning capacity and adaptability of individual investors. The market is a game-theoretic system; the relationship between the "harvester" and the "harvested" is dynamic and symbiotic. If the harvested disappear, the harvester loses its basis for existence. Moreover, this ecology forms a cycle, creating a dynamic equilibrium in a triangular game. Often, choosing an ecological niche is key to an individual investor's success, not whether they can obtain an absolute advantage. Holders of the "Individual Inevitable Defeat" theory always view the market too one-sidedly, ignoring its complexity and dynamism. **This is a typical mindset of seeing a flaw and negating the entire thing.**

Holders of this view often also believe that the ultimate winners are always the large institutions and professional teams. However, professional teams also started as individual investors. They grew into professional teams through continuous learning and adaptation to the market. Institutions and individuals differ only in form, scale, resources, and stage of development, not in essence. Individual investors can completely, through a protracted war, gradually accumulate experience and capital, ultimately achieving the goal of class transcendence.

There is also a subtle variation among holders of this view: the belief that there might ultimately be a winner-takes-all situation, where individual investors can never survive in the market and will be completely eliminated. If this were truly the case, the harvesters would lose their basis for existence, and the market ecology could not be sustained. Therefore, this view is also untenable.

Furthermore, this is a **cynical** viewpoint, attempting to evade the reality of the market by negating the capabilities of individual investors. By not participating in this market, can individual investors truly avoid being harvested? This is merely an ostrich mentality. The economy has long engulfed everyone. In today's world, most currencies are pegged to the US dollar, whose value is closely tied to US Treasury bonds, which are used to develop the United States. Many people accumulate wealth but dare not invest in the market, only to find their wealth constantly shrinking due to inflation, ultimately becoming the harvested. In the future, even if the US falls, another country will take up its mantle and continue issuing the global reserve currency. This is unavoidable because the essence of wealth is control over resources. Wealth that cannot be exchanged for resources from others is ultimately illusory.

**The entire world is already "chained together."**

Faced with this situation, there are two choices: withdrawal from the world (出世) and engagement with the world (入世). Clearly, withdrawal is beyond the scope of this article; those who transcend have no worries about wealth.
Since withdrawal is impossible, one can only engage. Individual investors must learn to survive and develop within this market. **Individual investors must face the reality of the market and accept its challenges to find their own place within it.** Individual investors need to continuously learn and adapt to the market, gradually accumulating experience and capital, ultimately achieving the goal of class transcendence.

**Although individual investors are at a disadvantage in many aspects, they also possess a unique political cost advantage: independence.**

Any decision involving more than one interest-bearing entity faces political problems of **coordination costs** and **conflicts of interest**. Individual investors do not have these problems. Their independence allows them to adjust strategies more flexibly and focus more intently on their own goals without needing to consider others' interests. This independence enables individual investors to find their place in the market and, through continuous learning and adaptation, ultimately achieve sustained wealth growth.

Obviously, in terms of investment decision-making, it's hard to say that multiple people are necessarily more advantageous than one person. From decision-making ability, financial power, execution capability, and other aspects, individual investors do not have inherent defects.

For example, here are some relative advantages stemming from the political cost advantage:

*   **Adaptability**: Individual investors can at least choose not to participate in certain markets and can choose to learn and adapt to market changes, unrestricted. Institutions often need to maintain established business models, making rapid adjustments difficult.
*   **Flexibility**: Allows individual investors to quickly adjust strategies to adapt to market changes without going through cumbersome approval processes. Institutions often require multi-level approvals, leading to slow responses.
*   **Liquidity**: Individual investors can enter and exit markets almost without restriction, choosing different investment instruments and markets. Institutions are often limited by capital scale and regulatory requirements.

If individual investors can fully utilize these advantages and continuously learn and adapt to the market, they can certainly achieve success in the market. In the AI era, individual investors can use AI tools to quickly compensate for their disadvantages, such as obtaining information, analyzing data, **writing code for trading strategies**, etc., thereby enhancing their advantages. Especially writing code for trading strategies, as mentioned later, systematic trading at the execution level is key to implementing the protracted war. Even if individual investors cannot code themselves, they can use AI to assist in writing code to achieve systematic trading, which is already a proven feasible solution.

### **Refuting the "All-in for Sudden Wealth" Theory (Opportunism)**

On the other hand, a minority in the market advocate the strategy of "betting it all for a chance," believing that a one-time high-risk investment can achieve rapid wealth growth. This strategy seems to solve the time problem of individual wealth growth but actually ignores the importance of risk management. Those who hold this view and act on it are either novices uninitiated by the market or gamblers with little left to lose. They often believe their luck can overcome market risks, but reality is often otherwise.

All-in investments often come with enormous risks. Once they fail, they can lead to severe personal wealth loss or even bankruptcy. Moreover, opportunities in the market are not something everyone can seize; the probability of success is often very low. Therefore, relying solely on an all-in investment strategy cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. Currently, in the MEME market, there are many myths of sudden wealth, with stories of overnight thousand-fold or ten-thousand-fold gains emerging endlessly, attracting a large number of speculators into the market. However, these stories often ignore the underlying risks and failure cases, leading many speculators chasing the dream of sudden wealth to ultimately fall into bankruptcy.

Some people appear to go all-in, but in reality, the funds they bet each time are not their entire capital but all the funds on their "gambling table." Even if they lose, they have reserves. These are not the holders of the "All-in for Sudden Wealth" theory we wish to discuss. However, under certain conditions, such individuals can also become true all-in investors, for example, when the funds on their table are close to their total capital. Those accustomed to all-in investing are increasingly likely to become true all-in investors.

Comparatively, most people understand this principle. But when opportunities arise, they are often too quickly overwhelmed by the desire for sudden wealth, transforming into all-in investors. This is the most common mistake individual investors make during the future strategic stalemate phase. It is necessary to prepare psychologically in advance to prevent losing rationality and making wrong decisions when opportunities come.

This is both a crisis and an opportunity. **The more people advocate all-in for sudden wealth, the more it indicates the existence of huge volatility and蕴含 (implies)巨大的机会 (great opportunities) in the market. The more热衷于 (enthusiastic) people are about gambling, the more they can perceive the existence of high-volatility markets.** Individual investors need to清醒地认识到 (clearly recognize) that all-in investment strategies cannot guarantee sustained personal wealth growth and may instead lead to rapid wealth depletion. However, if one can适度地利用 (moderately utilize) all-in strategies under the premise of controllable risk, then individual investors can certainly achieve rapid wealth growth in the market.

### **Refuting the "Steady Development" Theory (Dogmatism)**

The last, and most classic, viewpoint. I criticize it as representative of **dogmatism**. It presents seemingly reasonable arguments to prove that personal wealth growth must rely on steady development strategies. However, this view ignores the time constraint problem of personal wealth growth. There are also many popular aphorisms, such as "be a friend of time," "the magic of compound interest," etc., which all sound very reasonable.

Traditionally,破除 (overthrowing) dogmatism has been very difficult because it often wears the cloak of rationality, making it hard to discern its true nature.

The still-living legend—Warren Buffett, the god of stocks and pioneer of value investing—is the greatest representative of this view. He advocates achieving steady annual growth of around 20% by holding优质资产 (quality assets) long-term. This view is indeed applicable to a certain extent for institutional investors and most individual investors. However, it does not solve **the fundamental contradiction of the personal wealth class transcendence problem—the contradiction between the有限性 (limitation) of individual lifespan and the time required to accumulate wealth.**

In this world, there are不少 (not few) people as long-lived as Buffett, but there is only one stock god. There are also many who know and practice value investing. If everyone could develop smoothly如同“熬资历” (like "serving time to gain seniority"), where would all this extra money come from? If you can accumulate wealth through time, then your predecessors, who came before you, could do so even more. Every individual investor should掂量一下 (weigh in their heart) whether they have overlooked some blind spot. In this world, are there隐形壁垒 (invisible barriers) hindering wealth growth? If so, what are they? If not, why can't most people achieve leapfrog wealth growth?

The fundamental困境 (dilemma) faced by individual investors is:

1.  Wanting steady growth, but steadily growing wealth cannot keep up with逐年增加 (yearly increasing) living expenses. One cannot accumulate wealth without eating or drinking.
2.  Wanting to increase accumulation, but accumulation plans are always interrupted by sudden risk events—unemployment, illness, or family变故 (changes).
3.  Wanting to苟住发展 (hold on and develop cautiously), but social relations催促着 (urge)必须提升 (must improve) quality of life—buying houses, cars, getting married, having children, maintaining面子工程 (face-saving projects), etc.
4.  Wanting to搏一搏 (take a chance), but fearing the loss of existing积累 (accumulation), unable to bear the risks of大起大落 (sharp ups and downs).

There are many theories in the market teaching how to make wealth grow steadily, how to avoid risks, and how to earn 10-30% returns every year.
Such strategies include but are not limited to:

*   **Value Investing**: Selecting undervalued quality assets, holding them long-term, and waiting for the market to correct their prices.
*   **Risk Parity & Permanent Portfolio**: Reducing overall portfolio risk by diversifying across different asset classes and定期再平衡 (periodically rebalancing).
*   **Index Investing**: Investing in market indices to obtain the market's average return, avoiding individual stock risk, and同步 (synchronizing) with the growth of the national economic environment.

If so, by the time assets increase tenfold, it will be ten years later, life will have entered the next stage, and as life becomes increasingly stable, the meaning of wealth growth diminishes. If individuals rely solely on steady development strategies to achieve wealth growth, they likely cannot achieve leapfrog wealth growth before the end of their lifespan. Moreover, if wealth does not arrive when individuals need it most, when they are old, does pursuing leapfrog wealth growth still hold much meaning? Isn't having enough sufficient?

Some also幻想 (fantasize) that they can achieve wealth growth for后代 (future generations) through inheritance,以此作为 (using this as) their own meaning. However, "崽卖爷田不心疼" (children selling their ancestors' land don't feel the pain)—this thinking is very unrealistic. Each generation has its own奋斗目标和生活方式 (struggle goals and lifestyle). Future generations未必会珍惜 (may not cherish) the wealth accumulated by predecessors and might even squander it. Therefore, leaving wealth to the next generation is未必是一件有意义的事情 (not necessarily a meaningful thing). Inheritance is meaningful only when both wealth and思想 (thought) are传承 (passed down).甚至 (Even) the传承 of thought is more important; it is the main thing.

The scenario for steady development is completely different from that of ordinary people. **I emphasize that I am refuting those dogmatic views that advocate steady development under any circumstances.** Refuting the steady development theory sounds somewhat离经叛道 (heretical), but in reality, the steady development theory is not a pragmatic choice for individual investors. Individual investors need to清醒地认识到 (clearly recognize) that the time for wealth growth is limited, and steady development strategies often cannot achieve leapfrog wealth growth within that limited time. Therefore, individual investors need to find a strategy that can achieve wealth growth within a relatively short period, not just rely on steady development strategies.

Of course, contradictions can转换 (transform)—when personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development strategies become more important because the wealth is then sufficient to support personal living needs. Steady development strategies can help individuals maintain stable wealth growth and avoid wealth loss due to market fluctuations. Moreover, as a base for the next round of wealth growth, steady development strategies can provide individuals with a根据地 (base area), preparing for another battle for class transcendence.

However, before personal wealth reaches a certain scale, steady development strategies are not the best choice for individual investors to achieve wealth growth. Individual investors need to find a strategy that can achieve wealth growth within a relatively short period, not just rely on steady development strategies.

## The Protracted War of Capital

The protracted war I speak of does not mean a protracted war in the temporal sense, but achieving leapfrog wealth growth through a publicly available strategy. It consists of several aspects:

1.  Learn to correctly judge敌我矛盾 (contradictions between ourselves and the enemy) and the形势 (situation) to formulate correct strategic guidelines.
2.  Prepare a stable cash flow input, **control the maximum speed of losses**, thereby achieving survival during weakness.
3.  Learn to maintain cumulative advantage, avoid unnecessary time消耗 (consumption) from盯盘 (watching the market), thereby achieving continuous expansion of advantage.
4.  Learn to press the advantage at the appropriate时机 (moment),决战决胜 (decisively fight and win), and not miss historical opportunity windows.
5.  Establish psychological expectations, **accept the possibility of ending up with nothing gained**, thereby avoiding psychological崩溃 (breakdown) due to failure.

### Mathematical Interpretation

This theory has a mathematical interpretation:

First, set the victory condition as wealth reaching a certain value $A$. The goal of all strategies is to achieve this victory condition. This victory condition differs for each person, depending on individual living needs and wealth goals.

Second, assume there exists a strategy $S$, which is a black-box investment machine. It inputs capital $x$ at time $t_0$ and outputs capital $y$ at time $t_1$. We can define this strategy function with 3 parameters. Once these 3 parameters are determined, the output capital $y$ is determined:

$$
y = S(x, t_0, t_1)
$$

This function is not a mathematical function with an analytical expression but an abstract representation of a black-box investment machine. Its inputs are a time period and capital; its output is capital. Furthermore, $x$ in $S$ also has an objective domain $[L, U]$, i.e., $L \le x \le U$. This represents the lower and upper limits of investment capital; individual investors cannot invest below $L$ or above $U$. $L$ represents the market's minimum transaction amount, and $U$ represents the market's capital承载容量 (carrying capacity) for this strategy.

Clearly, this defines a basic investment concept: between time $t_0$ and $t_1$, investing capital $x$ yields capital $y$. If $y > x$, the strategy is profitable; if $y < x$, it is loss-making.

Now, define our capital curve $F(t)$, representing the total收益 (profit/loss) at time $t$. Our goal is for the capital curve $F(t)$ to reach the victory condition $A$ at some time $T_W$.

$$
\exists_{T_W}  F(T_W) \ge A
$$

Now, at our initial investment time $T_0$, we first need to define a bottom-line risk control line:

$$F(t) \ge - C \cdot (t - T_0)$$

Here, $C$ is a constant representing the maximum loss speed we can承受 (bear). The meaning of this risk control line is that we must ensure that at any time $t$, our capital curve $F(t)$ does not fall below this line. This way, we can ensure survival capability during weakness. The setting of $C$ varies from person to person, depending on individual cash flow capability. For example, investing 3000 yuan per month means $C = 100$ yuan/day.

An investment action can be defined as using strategy $S$ to invest capital $x$ ($0 < x < A$) within a certain time period $[t_0, t_1]$, thereby obtaining capital $y$. This action can be expressed as:

$$
F(t_1) = F(t_0) - x + S(x, t_0, t_1)
$$

Our goal is to, through a series of investment actions,最终使得 (ultimately make) the capital curve $F(t)$ reach the victory condition $A$ at some time $T_W$, while ensuring that at any time $t$, the capital curve $F(t)$ does not fall below the risk control line.

Furthermore, we can define profit $P(t)$ as the浮盈 (floating profit) above the risk control line:

$$
P(t) = F(t) - C \cdot (t - T_0)
$$

You will find that even without any investment action, $P(t)$ increases linearly over time. This is because the risk control line itself declines linearly, while the capital curve $F(t)$ remains unchanged without investment actions. Therefore, $P(t)$ increases linearly over time.

When $P(t)$ reaches $L$, we can use all of $P(t)$ as the investment capital $x = P(t)$ for the next investment action. This is the so-called **profit-based position sizing strategy**.

$$
F(t_1) = F(t_0) - P(t_0) + S(P(t_0), t_0, t_1)
$$

This strategy, under连续 (continuous) profitable conditions, can achieve rapid growth of the capital curve $F(t)$, thereby achieving leapfrog wealth growth. Because our purpose is to make $F(T_W) \ge A$, there is only one other outcome: $F(t) = -C \cdot t$, which means the capital curve $F(t)$ directly declines along the risk control line, waiting for the next opportunity.

Next, for the victory target $A$, strategy $S$, and risk control parameter $C$, we can construct a全新的 (completely new) backtesting evaluation system.

Measure how long strategy $S$ takes to achieve victory target $A$, denoted as $T_S(A, C)$. This time $T_S(A, C)$ is a random variable, depending on the performance of strategy $S$ and market volatility. To simplify the explanation, assume A = 10 million, C = 100 yuan/day. Evaluation shows that in 5 years of history, strategy S on average achieves victory target A once per year. This means you need to定投 (invest fixed amounts of) 100 yuan/day,持续 (continuously) for 1 year, to possibly catch one opportunity to earn 10 million. Your cost is 36500 yuan/year, and the收益 (return) is 10 million. Clearly, this is a very划算 (cost-effective) investment; you would be very patient when investing. But what if it happens only once every 5 years? Once every 10 years? Then it's not划算, and the risk is很大 (very high). Everyone, how many decades does a person have?

![How Many Decades in a Life](czon://0bd4a05f453adf84da38573adbab5a68736df318b793d91534f8c0ff321329a8)

Now, based on one's own resources, evaluate the expectation of achieving victory under different conditions, and then commit. If deemed unacceptable, do not commit. Then spend time optimizing strategy S, improving its win rate, reducing the time $T_S(A, C)$ needed to achieve victory target A. This process is one of continuous optimization and adjustment until a strategy S is found that can achieve victory target A within an acceptable time frame.

This is the mathematical interpretation of the protracted war of capital.

### Practical Rules

It sounds complex, but in practice, it's simple.

1.  **Must prepare a cash flow input**. Use time cost to换取 (exchange for) information and experience advantage. There must be a continuously investable, controllable cash flow. This can be salary income or stable interest income. This cash flow doesn't need to be large but must be stable. With this cash flow, one can continuously make small investments in the market, accumulating information and experience advantage.
2.  **Must use systematic trading methods** for底层 (underlying) investment operations, avoiding any emotional or humanly unsustainable decisions, preventing纪律性 (disciplinary) problems at the execution stage. Moreover, systematic trading can save individual investors'精力 (energy), reducing psychological pressure from懊悔 (regret) over exiting to保本 (break even). Do not pursue a fully automatic system but pursue an imperfect yet省心 (worry-saving) profitable system. **Investors must focus their energy on designing and optimizing program strategies.** If you can't code, let AI help. Do not盯盘 (watch the market), do not纠结于 (agonize over) whether to buy or sell in each trade. This does not liberate you; it tortures you. This is what I call the key to accumulating advantage and avoiding unnecessary消耗 (consumption).
3.  **Profits must be immediately used to加仓 (increase position)**. When capital is invested in the correct direction, profits will quickly appear. Use the profit-based position sizing strategy to continuously expand advantage. Note: there is a very strict stop-loss condition here: if losses reach the pre-position-sizing loss level,必须止损 (must stop loss). This is because market volatility is聚集的 (clustered); tailwinds and headwinds are often clustered. If one can抓住 (seize) the opportunity of clustered tailwinds, then one can use the profit-based position sizing strategy to continuously expand advantage. Increasing position means your成本线 (cost line) rises. The安全缓冲区 (safety buffer) between the cost line and the current净值线 (net value line) is formed. When the buffer变小 (becomes smaller), if the current车速 (speed of change) is still too fast, the program should触发减仓 (trigger position reduction) to prevent被穿仓 (being wiped out).

This endeavor ultimately has two outcomes: one, successfully achieving leapfrog wealth growth; two, failing with limited losses.
Regardless of the outcome, individual investors can坦然接受 (calmly accept) it and learn and grow from it.

**Correctly Understanding Margin and Leverage**

A practical question: if拿出 (setting aside) 6000 yuan per month, approximately 200 yuan/day for investment, what can you buy? Almost nothing.

This misunderstands the concept of cash flow; it is to填补亏损 (cover losses). For example, buying one lot requires 10,000 yuan. Your 200 yuan/day cash flow means you can accept a 2% loss speed per day, which is actually not insignificant. If it exceeds this speed, you need to主动退出市场 (actively exit the market) to prevent excessive losses.

This differs from another investment style: saving tens of thousands over several months, investing it all at once, setting no stop-loss,不敢认输 (daring not admit defeat) when losing, watching one's底线 (bottom line) being摩擦 (ground) by the market; when winning,拼命加仓 (desperately increasing position),生怕 (fearing) missing发财的机会 (the chance to get rich),结果 (ending up)架在山顶 (stuck at the peak),活脱脱成了 (becoming nothing less than)山顶资本 (peak capital). This is completely失控的状态 (an out-of-control state),可叹 (lamentable).

Determining position size based on potential loss is a basic fund management concept. For this,学好小学数学 (learning elementary school math well) and correctly solving word problems is necessary.

**Difference from "Heavy Betting When Seeing an Opportunity"**

The difference from "heavy betting when seeing an opportunity" is that it doesn't require seeing an opportunity. Instead, it lets the market automatically筛选出 (filter out) the correct opportunities—those that can continuously expand profits. And when the market reverses, the stop-loss is set at the pre-position-sizing loss level, thereby controlling losses within a manageable range.

**Is It Possible to Lose Forever?**

Possible. This is because the strategy itself is not good enough, or the expected time to win is simply too long, making it unsustainable.

However, even if losing forever, losses are within a controllable range. Individual investors can continuously adjust and optimize strategies, ultimately finding one that can achieve victory.

**Relationship with Steady Growth?**

After achieving leapfrog wealth growth, individual investors can choose to转移 (transfer)部分资金 (part of the funds) to steady growth strategies to maintain stable wealth growth. Steady growth strategies can help individual investors avoid wealth loss due to market fluctuations, thereby achieving long-term stable wealth growth. Steady growth strategies can serve as a base for the next round of wealth growth, providing individual investors with a根据地 (base area), preparing for another battle for class transcendence.

## Summary

The key points总结下来 (summarized) are:

1.  Start from cash flow, control loss speed to achieve survival during weakness.
2.  Use systematic trading to avoid emotional decisions, achieving continuous expansion of advantage.
3.  Utilize profit-based position sizing to press the advantage, achieving leapfrog wealth growth. Even if failing, losses are equivalent to pre-position-sizing losses,不会击穿现金流 (will not breach the cash flow).

The specific systematic strategy is the decisive key to victory. The core of this article lies in重新定义 (redefining) the goal and criteria for victory, thereby providing individual investors with a feasible strategic path to achieve leapfrog wealth growth.

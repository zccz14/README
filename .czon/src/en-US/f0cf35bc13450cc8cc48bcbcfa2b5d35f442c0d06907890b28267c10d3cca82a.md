"title": "Work Log: Reflections and Planning on the Pyramiding Strategy"
"summary": "This is a work log documenting the author's work and thoughts on January 17, 2026. The author's efficiency was reduced due to a cold, but they continued to delve into the pyramiding strategy, considering it an effective capital management method that leverages volatility clustering for rapid capital growth. Inspired by 'On Protracted War' and stories of futures trading veterans, the author plans to systematize the strategy and supports its potential with real-world examples (such as an experience shared on X platform growing from $12 to $100,000). Additionally, the author reflects on the purpose of keeping a log, viewing it not just as a record but also as material accumulation for AI training and future planning, and expresses gratitude for the team's support allowing focused thinking."

2026-01-17, Afternoon.

Last night, I actually went to bed before midnight because I was too tired. Woke up very late this morning with a terrible headache—probably caught a cold.
Quickly made a meal and took some medicine. Looks like today's work efficiency won't be high. Yesterday, I re-read 'On Protracted War' because I was planning an article on 'Pyramiding is the Only Way for Capital Management,' wanting to find historical examples to support the viewpoint and learn from the wisdom of great figures. Also re-read C1's blog and realized that while I once said 'Who keeps a diary seriously?', I now find myself writing something similar, which is quite interesting. But back then, I was just referencing a meme, a line from the movie 'Hidden Man.'

Honestly, what I write isn't exactly a diary; it's more like a work log, recording daily tasks and reflections. While some content is trivial, some involves planning and thinking about future projects and directions. On the other hand, this is also preparation for AI training. After all, future AI assistants need to understand my work habits and thought processes to better assist me with tasks. Furthermore, by the end of 2026, I'll have accumulated enough content. I wonder what my 2026 year-end summary will look like then.

Thanks to delegating work to the team, otherwise I'd probably be busy day and night with no time to write these things. I hope to have more time and energy in the future to think about and plan larger projects and directions, rather than being tied down by trivial tasks. Grateful for the team's support and help, allowing me to focus on thinking and planning.

Regarding recent work, the 'pyramiding' strategy actually sprouted years ago when I heard stories about futures trading veterans. While others marveled at their ability to pick assets and timing, I started pondering the potential of the 'pyramiding' capital management strategy. When I [asked on the 16th](czon://243f24730d79d403e0b4e6bc2368ae67bfb83fdd54fbd47de54d11044638e325) how to make 20 million in a year, the approach for the 'pyramiding' strategy had already taken shape in my mind. Next, I need to systematize this strategy into a complete capital management framework and validate its effectiveness through practical application.

This morning, Brother Ji sent a message saying someone on X shared their experience of growing from $12 to $100,000, primarily using an all-in pyramiding strategy, achieving this through 16 consecutive wins. It seems this strategy indeed has its unique appeal and potential, worthy of in-depth study and application. In pure gambling games, this likely involves a lot of luck. But in market trading, favorable and unfavorable conditions often cluster (aka. volatility clustering). If one can seize opportunities during favorable clustering and utilize the pyramiding strategy, it is indeed possible to achieve rapid capital growth.

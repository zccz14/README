It is now the evening of February 5, 2026.

I read C1's blog work log, wanting to understand the details of what he's been busy with lately. It feels like he doesn't update very frequently, but he also mentioned his [reasons](https://0xc1.space/czon/zh-Hans/2026-work-log-ai-agent-collaboration.html#2026-01-31) for not recording daily:

> The past few days have been quite packed, so I didn't record anything. However, stopping the recording is not an option, so I'm picking it up now and will record everything together.
> Besides being busy, why didn't I record?
>
> 1.  Because I was afraid that recording would require sitting down and spending over 30 minutes specifically to document a day. This fear and burden associated with recording daily life is actually undesirable.
> 2.  Usually, I'm only willing to start recording a day after it has truly ended. But upon reflection, this is somewhat counterintuitive because I now basically go to bed as soon as it's time to sleep, not because everything I wanted to do is actually finished (does that ever really happen?). This leads to a situation where I don't record when I have time, and when it's really time to record, I have to quickly get into bed, compounded by issue #1.
>
> The combination of these two leads to a growing backlog.

My comments are:

## Fragmented Writing is Better Than Comprehensive Writing

**Writing fragmented records instead of comprehensive ones is a win-win for both AI and humans**. There's no need to wait until a "complete day" ends to record. Write down whatever comes to mind, and a day doesn't necessarily have to result in only one log entry. For example, I might post several log entries daily, all containing fragmented content, though each individual piece won't be too thematically scattered. This is a more AI-friendly format for compression (summarization). AI can easily extract the core information from fragmented content and help you integrate it into more systematic knowledge. However, if you make a single log entry too cluttered, AI will have a harder time extracting the key points.

## Writing Beforehand is Also Important

During the Thinking phase, AI writes beforehand, and human thinking should follow the same principle. **Writing beforehand and writing afterward are complementary**. Writing beforehand helps clarify thoughts, while writing afterward aids in summarizing and reflecting. Neither can be omitted.

## Regarding Cross-Platform Comments

Speaking of which, why must my comments on his log be stored on his blog?

I will store them on my own blog. I only need to reference his content to comment; I don't particularly care whether visitors to his blog can see my comments. Whether he sees them, or other third parties see them, is a matter of interconnectivity for internet products to solve. Comments, in essence, are "reference + commentary," and the referenced content can be any public content. Comments don't necessarily have to be stored on the platform of the person being commented on.

So, what if the content I commented on is deleted by him? It doesn't matter, because I don't need to prove that he actually said something. I only need to record my perspective on something. The referenced content is merely to provide context for the reader of my comment. If the contextual excerpt is complete, who cares if the original text still exists?

Preserving the content of the person being commented on is a problem for internet archives to solve. And I, as a commenter, am also indirectly preserving the content of the person being commented on.

Data ownership of comments lies with the commenter, not the person being commented on. This is the logic comments should follow.

However, cross-platform comments, as an interesting technical concept, can actually be implemented. This is similar to backlinks. It just requires joint rendering by combining content from both parties. If we both use CZON to build our systems, we could pull each other's `meta.json` files and render the comment content within our own CZON systems. This way, comments could be stored cross-platform.

But I'm curious, is there a content system that cannot be withdrawn? That would probably require a publicly auditable blockchain system, right? As an author, when would you absolutely need to write to a non-withdrawable content system?

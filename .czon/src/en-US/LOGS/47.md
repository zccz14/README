The author argues that fragmented recording is superior to comprehensive recording because AI can more easily extract the core information from fragmented content and integrate it into systematic knowledge. It also emphasizes the importance of 'writing beforehand,' suggesting it helps clarify thoughts, while 'writing afterward' is for summarization and reflection, with the two being complementary. The article discusses the concept of cross-site commenting, proposing that comment data ownership should reside with the commenter, not the commented party, and explores the technical feasibility of implementing cross-site commenting. The core ideas are optimizing recording methods to enhance AI collaboration efficiency and reflecting on the nature of commenting systems."

It is the evening of February 5, 2026.

I read the work logs on C1's blog, wanting to understand the details of what he's been busy with lately. It feels like he doesn't update very frequently, but he also mentioned his [reasons](https://0xc1.space/czon/zh-Hans/2026-work-log-ai-agent-collaboration.html#2026-01-31) for not recording daily:

> The past few days have been quite packed, so I didn't record anything. However, stopping recording is not an option, so I'm picking it up now and recording everything together.
> Besides being busy, why didn't I record?
>
> 1.  Because I was afraid that recording would require sitting down and spending over 30 minutes specifically to record a day. This is actually due to some fear and burden regarding recording daily life, which is not advisable.
> 2.  Usually, I'm only willing to start recording a day after it has truly ended. But upon careful thought, this is somewhat anti-human because I now basically go to bed as soon as it's time to sleep, not because everything I wanted to do is actually finished (does that ever really happen?). This leads to not recording when I have time, and then when it's really time to record, I have to quickly get into bed, compounded by issue 1.
>
> The combination of these two leads to a growing backlog.

My comments are:

## Fragmented Writing is Better Than Comprehensive Writing

**Writing fragmented records instead of comprehensive records is a win-win for both AI and humans.** There's no need to wait until a "complete day" ends to record. Write down whatever comes to mind; a day doesn't necessarily have to result in only one log entry. For example, I might post several log entries daily, all containing fragmented content, though each entry's theme isn't too scattered. This is a more AI-friendly format for compression (summarization). AI can easily extract the core information from fragmented content and then help integrate it into more systematic knowledge. However, if one writes a single log entry with overly cluttered content, AI will find it harder to extract the key points.

## Writing Beforehand is Also Important

During the Thinking phase, AI writes beforehand; human Thinking should be the same. **Writing beforehand and writing afterward are complementary.** Writing beforehand helps clarify thoughts, while writing afterward helps with summarization and reflection. Neither can be omitted.

Writing beforehand, even if the planned task isn't completed, at least yields a record of the Thinking process. This helps pick it up better next time and provides key information for AI design. Sometimes, I directly give my blog posts, or even the entire blog, to an AI Agent, asking it to further plan according to my train of thought. It can do this quite well now.

Writing beforehand doesn't require significant extra effort. With the current level of inline predictive text completion, you only need to write a few words, and AI can help complete it into a full paragraph of thought. You just need to give it a general direction, and it can help write out the thought content. This way, you can easily accomplish writing beforehand.

**Writing beforehand is simply a huge win.**

## Regarding Cross-Site Commenting

Speaking of which, why must my comments on his logs be stored on his blog?

I will store them on my own blog. I only need to reference his content to comment; I don't really care whether visitors to his blog can see my comments. Whether he sees them, or other third parties see them, is a matter of interconnectivity for internet products to solve. Commenting, in essence, is "reference + commentary," and the referenced content can be any public content. Comments don't necessarily have to be stored on the platform of the commented party.

So, what if the content I commented on is deleted by him? It doesn't matter, because I don't need to prove he actually said something. I only need to record my perspective on something. The referenced content is merely to let readers understand the context of my comment. If the background excerpt is complete, who cares if the original text still exists?

Preserving the commented party's content is a problem for internet archives to solve. And I, as a commenter, indirectly preserve the commented party's content as well.

Comment data ownership lies with the commenter, not the commented party. This is the logic commenting should have.

However, cross-site commenting, as an interesting technical concept, is actually feasible. This is similar to backlinks. It just requires joint rendering of content from both parties. If we both use CZON to build our sites, we could pull each other's `meta.json` files and render the comment content within our own CZON systems. This way, comments could be stored cross-site.

But I'm curious, is there a content system that cannot be withdrawn? That would probably require a publicly auditable blockchain system, right? As an author, when would one absolutely need to write to a non-withdrawable content system?

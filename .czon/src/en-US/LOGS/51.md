It is now February 7, 2026, in the afternoon.

I've optimized CZON, mainly by removing the YAML Front Matter. Currently, the AI-powered metadata extraction feature is robust enough, eliminating the need to manually add this information.
Additionally, when translating metadata-related fields, CZON no longer relies on YAML Front Matter. Instead, it translates directly from JSON to JSON, which may increase the number of AI calls slightly. However, for AI services billed by usage, this has minimal impact.
In other words, it is strongly advised not to use this translation feature with AI services billed per call. On a side note, I believe the translation function can utilize free-tier AI services, as the task is straightforward and requires almost no inference capability.

CZON has added more metadata fields and optimized some SEO-related content.

Furthermore, I am currently working on modifying SandTable to enable it to accept real historical market data for testing. However, I still need to address some of SandTable's lingering technical debt.

During my spare time while guiding AI work, I'm writing a little log.

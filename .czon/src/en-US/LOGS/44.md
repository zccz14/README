I recall that yesterday, setting up GB's CZON encountered some setbacks again. We first struggled with the HTTP proxy, then had a brief lesson on the concept of OPENAI Compatible, switching from Gemini to OpenAI and then to DeepSeek. Finally, we got stuck on the GitHub Pages configuration. After twists and turns, we finally managed to get GB up and running.

However, this is not a good thing; it doesn't align with my aesthetic of simplicity. GB is actually my ideal user group, yet I couldn't make their usage process smooth. This is a warning sign, indicating that I didn't consider enough edge cases when designing CZON.

But there's no other way. I should let them use CZONE first, and when they have the need to independently manage their data, I can switch them to CZON. However, the initial development of CZONE failed last time, but now with the unlimited power of Opus, it can be re-implemented.

CZONE should guide users as smoothly as possible through the entire process—from starting from scratch, writing something, to publishing it on the internet. Throughout this process, users should not feel any obstacles. Pick up the phone, open CZONE, write something, and publish it to the website. It should be as simple as posting on social media.

Still, I am grateful for GB's feedback; it is very valuable user experience data. Moreover, GB actively helped promote CZON to his colleagues. Although I understand this came from personal connections rather than the product's inherent appeal, it is still a good start. If a product doesn't seem appealing in concept, people won't actively promote it for you.

Keep going, and don't let down the enthusiasm of these early users.

"title": "Reflections on CZON Development and CZONE Optimization Plan"
"summary": "This article records the author's reflections on the CZON development process on February 4, 2026. The author mentions encountering issues such as HTTP proxy, API switching, and GitHub Pages configuration while setting up CZON for GB, leading to a poor user experience. This serves as a warning about insufficient consideration of edge cases in product design. The author decides to let users start with the more simplified CZONE first, switching to CZON only when they have a need for autonomous data control. The goal of CZONE is to provide a seamless workflow from writing to publishing, offering an experience as simple as posting on social media. The author thanks GB for the feedback and promotion, considering it valuable early user data, and emphasizes the importance of not disappointing the enthusiasm of these users."

It is now 2:00 PM on February 4, 2026.

I recall encountering some setbacks yesterday while setting up CZON for GB. We first struggled with the HTTP proxy, then went through an explanation of the OPENAI Compatible concept, switching from Gemini to OpenAI and then to DeepSeek. Finally, we got stuck on the GitHub Pages configuration. After a series of twists and turns, we finally managed to get GB up and running.

However, this is not a good thing; it doesn't align with my aesthetic of simplicity. GB is actually part of my ideal user group, yet I couldn't make his usage process smooth. This is a warning sign, indicating that I didn't consider enough edge cases when designing CZON.

But there's no helping it. I should have let him use CZONE first, and only switched him to CZON when he developed a need for autonomous data control. However, the initial development of CZONE failed last time. Now, with the unlimited power of Opus, it can be re-implemented.

CZONE should guide users as smoothly as possible through the entire process from starting from scratch, writing something, to publishing it on the internet. Users should not feel any obstacles during this process. Pick up the phone, open CZONE, write something, publish it to the website. It should be as simple as posting on social media.

Nevertheless, I am still grateful for GB's feedback; it is very valuable user experience data. Moreover, GB actively promoted CZON to his colleagues. Although I understand this was out of personal rapport rather than the product's inherent appeal, it's still a good start. A product that doesn't seem appealing in concept wouldn't be actively promoted by others.

Keep going, and don't disappoint the enthusiasm of these early users.

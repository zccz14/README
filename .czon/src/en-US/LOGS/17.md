"title": "Exploring AI Tone Rewriting Features and Productization Considerations"
"summary": "On January 18, 2026, while using Claude Code to summarize documents, the author tested various tones such as objective/neutral, harsh, and sycophantic, discovering that the AI's tone rewriting feature tended to overlook factual accuracy. After adding prompts to emphasize factual attention, the generated critical version, literary/emotional version, and personality analysis version summaries all yielded excellent results. Particularly, the personality analysis version inferred the author as an INTJ type based on the writing content, providing insightful observations. The author believes that sticking to the facts is a crucial principle, and AI should not sacrifice factual accuracy to cater to a specific tone. Based on this exploration, the author considered opportunities to productize the AI summarization feature, analyzing challenges such as market demand, dissemination formats, and costs, and plans to first create a prototype to test market response."

It is the morning of 2026-01-18.

I woke up a bit after 8 AM today, maintaining a normal routine. After getting up, I used Claude Code to summarize all my documents.

It defaulted to an objective and neutral tone, which I found quite good, as it could explore the content across the entire repository.

Afterwards, I asked it to try summarizing using a harsh tone. The result was indeed too harsh—a kind of harshness that ignored facts, a harshness for the sake of being harsh, which completely missed my requirements.

Then, I asked it to try summarizing using a sycophantic tone. The result was indeed too sycophantic—a kind of sycophancy that ignored facts, a sycophancy for the sake of being sycophantic, which also completely missed my requirements.

In short, I identified its problem: its tone rewriting feature **essentially overlooks factual accuracy**.

I believe it likely wasn't aware of this issue, which is why this happened. So, I added some prompts, instructing it to pay attention to facts, and tried again.

This time, it generated a critical version of the summary, and the result was unexpectedly good. I felt like I was receiving critique and guidance from a senior—balanced, with both praise and criticism, well-reasoned and evidence-based. It felt excellent. It pointed out my shortcomings while also affirming my strengths, making it acceptable because these were indeed indisputable facts.

Then, I asked it to generate a literary/emotional version of the summary, which also turned out very well. I felt like I was being celebrated by a bard—evocative, emotional, and engaging. It felt excellent. It depicted my efforts and achievements, allowing me to feel my own value, making me feel seen, heard, and understood.

Finally, I generated a personality analysis version of the summary, which was also very good. I felt like I was being analyzed by a psychologist—insightful, profound, and thought-provoking. It felt excellent. It revealed my motivations and behaviors, helping me understand my inner self. It identified me as an INTJ type, which I found interesting because my previous test results indicated I was an ENTP type. However, its data source was based on what I wrote, so I found its analysis more convincing. This is because I rarely reveal the personal, lived-in side of myself in my writing. And writers, by nature, tend to have a sample set that leans toward introspection and introversion, introducing some inherent bias.

Sticking to the facts is a commendable practice, and AI should also learn to stick to the facts rather than overlook them to cater to a specific tone.

If this were to be turned into a product, it would likely be highly shareable and could easily become a viral hit. Especially for year-end summaries—everyone likes to summarize but is often too lazy to do it themselves, or feels their own summaries aren't objective enough. Currently, there's no such product on the market, which presents a good opportunity.

However, in terms of dissemination, the current format of CZON's Markdown + GitHub isn't very suitable for mass appeal, as most people aren't familiar with this format and might even struggle to register a GitHub account. So, if it were to be productized, a more accessible format would need to be considered, such as a web application or mobile app. The product would also need an interactive UI, possibly prioritizing a mobile-first editing experience (this is still a question mark). Additionally, AI cost considerations are necessary, as generating AI content is still relatively expensive. Options could include a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model where users provide their own API keys to reduce operational costs, or a subscription-based model to cover expenses. In the early stages, to attract users, offering a free trial quota might be necessary.

This isn't my main focus, but it's still a worthwhile opportunity to dip my toes in. Perhaps I could start with a simple prototype to gauge market response. If the feedback is positive, further development and promotion could be considered.

Overall, today's gains were quite substantial—I feel like I've learned a lot.

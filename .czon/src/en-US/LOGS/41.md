"title": "Reflections on AI Programming Practices: OOP and Over-Compatibility Issues"
"summary": "Based on a record from February 3, 2026, this article reflects on issues in AI programming practices. The author points out that even SOTA models like Opus 4.5 are not suitable for writing object-oriented programming code, as AI lacks deep understanding and modeling capabilities for business domains. AI can repay technical debt through specific processes, but OOP and over-compatibility remain major challenges. Over-compatibility leads to code bloat and cognitive collapse, while programming is fundamentally a cognitive science problem requiring the handling of unique business logic. The article emphasizes that cognitive development is a spiral process, where code and experiments help gain cognition, which in turn leads to writing better code."

It is now 9:00 AM on February 3, 2026.

I had Opus 4.5 repay some technical debt for the experimental repository of the "Capital Protracted War," even though this technical debt was also created by it in the first place.

As I mentioned in my previous article, [Reflections on AI Programming Practices: Avoiding OOP and Over-Compatibility](./2.md), AI is currently not suitable for writing object-oriented programming code. Object-oriented programming requires a deep understanding and modeling capability of the business domain, which AI currently cannot handle. **Currently, even the SOTA model Opus 4.5 is no exception**.

AI can repay technical debt through specific processes. This truly embodies "**every debt has its debtor**"—at least I don't have to pay for the poor code it writes.

Let me emphasize the issues of OOP and over-compatibility again.

Programming fundamentally requires modeling the world and belongs to the realm of cognitive science. Most programming tasks involve handling many unique business problems. This is especially true for experimental code, where the tasks themselves often demand innovation. Therefore, AI sometimes struggles to understand a new concept suddenly introduced by the user, leading to incorrect modeling and erroneous code. As for the few tasks that are already well-understood, there are usually well-modeled, excellent codebases available... Why reinvent the wheel?

Over-compatibility essentially stems from AI not knowing whether certain code is still useful, making it hesitant to delete it, which leads to code bloat and maintenance difficulties. In object-oriented programming, states and methods, even if unused, are often retained because they *might* be useful. Its impact is similar to OOM (Out-Of-Memory), but while OOM causes process crashes, over-compatibility leads to cognitive collapse. This is a hidden pitfall.

**Cognitive development is a spiral process**. Neither AI nor humans can achieve it overnight. How to maintain functionality and manage debt during this spiral ascent is an important topic. Interestingly, code—or experiments themselves—can help us gain cognition, and that cognition, in turn, helps us write better code.

I am recording these thoughts for future reference. It's a wonderful experience to jot down my reflections while waiting for Opus to do its work.

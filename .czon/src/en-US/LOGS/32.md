"title": "CZON Product Optimization and CZONE Vision Analysis"
"summary": "This article documents the author's optimization work on the CZON product on January 28, 2026, including adding HTTP Proxy support for user GB to resolve OpenAI API call issues. The author reflects that CZON's closed-loop process is somewhat rigid and considers using GitHub Actions to achieve automated execution, thereby lowering the user barrier. Simultaneously, the article provides a detailed comparison with the vision of CZONE—a completely barrier-free content creation platform where users only need a GitHub login to create, edit, and publish content. The data is based on Markdown and Git, aligning with the Web3 ethos. The author plans to continue testing CZON's implementation and grapples with whether to pursue further optimizations to balance ease of use and technical complexity."

It is now Wednesday evening, January 28, 2026.

Yesterday, I pitched CZON to GB, who expressed interest. However, he encountered an issue where calling the OpenAI API required an HTTP Proxy, which CZON previously did not support. So, I spent some time today adding HTTP Proxy support to CZON. Awaiting further feedback from GB.

GB is the second CZON user after C1. I am preparing to test CZON's implementation. At this stage, we must not rush; we need to be steady and solid, first ensuring a good experience for early users. Only after establishing a certain user base should we consider large-scale promotion.

Currently, CZON's closed-loop process is still somewhat rigid. I am considering fully utilizing GitHub Actions to implement CZON's closed loop. That is, after a user submits content source files to the main branch, GitHub Actions would automatically trigger CZON's execution and then directly push the results back into the main branch (or create a PR). However, this would require configuring GitHub Secrets to store the OpenAI API Key, etc. This approach could eliminate the hassle of users running CZON locally, lowering the barrier to entry. (Of course, this still doesn't reach the completely barrier-free approach of CZONE, which is why I'm also debating whether to proceed with these optimizations.)

CZONE is positioned as a completely barrier-free product. Users only need a registered GitHub account, log in to CZONE via GitHub OAuth, and they can directly create a content site, write, and publish a static site—all without needing to navigate elsewhere. The mobile editing experience is similar to posting on a social media feed or Twitter, very simple and direct. The desktop editing experience is akin to using a WYSIWYG editor like Notion or Typora. Users can focus solely on content creation; CZONE handles everything else. The advantage of CZONE is that its foundation is based on Markdown and Git. Users' data completely belongs to them; they can export their data at any time or migrate it to other platforms. This aligns with the spirit of Web3.

If GB were using CZONE instead of CZON today, he wouldn't have needed to consider the HTTP Proxy issue at all.

I think I should probably recruit a few more users to test CZON's implementation.

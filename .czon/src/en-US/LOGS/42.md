# Some To-Do Items

It's February 4, 2026, 00:00.

Worked all day, overall a process of letting AI do the work while thinking. A bit tired, will continue tomorrow.

There are some worthwhile things to do, jotting them down.

## 1. Opening Up Our System

Regarding permissions within Yuan's host and the permissions for connecting to the host, can we implement an asymmetric design? That is, not all terminals connecting to the host receive the same permissions. This would help us better control permissions, and consequently, better open up our data. Currently, due to the lack of a permission mechanism within the host, we are forced to temporarily close off some data sources and dare not freely expose them to AI. Ultimately, this hinders the progress of experiments.

Specifically, can we grant permission to read SQL? Can we grant permission to write SQL? At the Method level, should access be allowed by default or denied by default? How should authorization be conducted? These questions all need careful design.

The benefit is that we could grant Yuan CLI higher permissions, allowing AI to work more effectively.

In the future, Yuan might become a data source and order execution platform. The strategies in between will likely be diverse. For now, besides Yuan's built-in Kernel+Agent strategy platform, there's Brother Ji's TimeLab strategy platform, and the persistent warfare experiment repository I've been working on recently. They are based on different design philosophies and tech stacks and may coexist in the future. However, these strategy platforms all need access to Yuan's data and order execution interfaces.

Therefore, how to design a good permission system is an important issue. **To open up, one must first set up defenses** (Fenghua accent).

## 2. Capability for AI Assetization

Recently, while using some relay APIs, I noticed they are using the New API project for user management and billing. Essentially, they are assetizing their subscription pools, buying wholesale and selling retail to users. However, this sales method, because it's not tied to a specific business, prevents them from commanding a high price. The bargaining power here is conceded to the upstream business side.

To some extent, this is AI API assetization, a primary form of AI assetization. Building upstream AI products can leverage underlying API assets to smooth out upstream business operations, allowing users to avoid directly facing the complexity of API configuration, thereby improving user experience. Direct product subscriptions, or pay-as-you-go products! Users only care about the final combined product, not how the underlying APIs are configured. This creates another layer of profit margin.

Currently, API KEY management remains a barrier for ordinary users. Many users are not familiar with the concept of API KEY, or even how to apply for and manage one. Therefore, intermediaries in the AI business still have significant opportunities. This is essentially a problem of information asymmetry. This type of profit is highly scalable.

Of course, I believe BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) will be a trend in the future. Users will want to use their own API Keys to avoid data leakage issues. On the other hand, users also want to purchase AI services at API cost price, without paying a markup to intermediaries. Actually, intermediaries also perform a lot of business assembly, which has value. BYOK on the business side can be an option, but in the next few years, before the concept of API KEY is fully popularized, BYOK will not become mainstream.

## 3. Enhancement of the User System

Supabase is still a good choice, but its user system still has some shortcomings. For example, it doesn't support passwordless login methods like PassKey. I thought of a solution to make Supabase support PassKey, inspired by:

**Using an admin (service_role) identity within an Edge Function to create a Supabase session for a specific user and obtain the access_token / refresh_token, then return it to the frontend.**

- Supabase doesn't have an official API for "admin directly generating a session for any user."
- The official recommended approach: Use the combination of `auth.admin.generateLink` + `auth.verifyOtp` in the backend (Edge Function) to simulate a magic link login flow, thereby obtaining the user's session object (which contains access_token / refresh_token, etc.).
- This entire process can be completed internally within the Edge Function, without actually sending an email to the user or requiring the user to click a link.

Therefore, we can fully implement PassKey login functionality via Edge Functions. From then on, based on Supabase's user system, users can register with email, log in with email, and then also log in with PassKey. The entire process is passwordless, offering a better user experience. However, PassKey is a heavyweight interaction method, not suitable for every operation. It's only suitable for binding to initial login and some important operations (like changing passwords, modifying payment methods, etc.). For regular session persistence, simply reuse Supabase's access_token / refresh_token mechanism; the JWT mechanism works very well.

## 4. Payment System

A very old yet practical problem: how to get users to pay? How to legally transfer funds to the company's receiving account? How can we link a QR code so users can scan to pay, and the money goes to the company's account? These issues all need to be resolved.

We will have several solutions; integrating with a payment platform might be a good choice. Must go through the process, will share later.

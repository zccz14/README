"summary": "This article first discusses the relationship between volatility and leverage, noting that volatility is more critical for traders because profits rely on price spreads, while leverage increases transaction costs. High leverage affects supply-demand balance by boosting trading demand, weakening liquidity, and thereby raising market volatility. This is essentially a transfer payment, allowing high-leverage traders to shift opportunities to low-leverage traders and liquidity providers. Next, the article analyzes the interaction among market participants (investors, speculators, market makers), describing the cyclical process of the market from rising volatility, declining volatility, collapse, to recovery, and mentions the possibility of market death. Finally, the article cites catastrophe theory to explain sudden market shifts."

It is now February 4, 2026, 2:00 PM.

Recalling the previously mentioned issue of [volatility and leverage](./26.md), my earlier view was that leverage can be reduced to volatility because they are mathematically equivalent in essence.

However, I have recently gained some new thoughts and understanding.

For traders, **volatility is more effective than leverage**. Making money through trading essentially relies on volatility; low volatility means negligible price spreads, making trading profits unattainable. Leverage comes at a cost, reflected in the linear increase in the nominal value of positions, which implies a linear rise in transaction costs.

This is easy to understand: a market with an inherent volatility of 10% using 1x leverage, and a market with an inherent volatility of 1% using 10x leverage, both yield the same profit or loss from price spreads. However, the transaction cost for the former is only one-tenth of the latter.

Yet, volatility does not arise out of thin air.

High leverage implies high trading demand, which affects the supply-demand balance, weakens liquidity, and thereby increases market volatility.

High volatility, in turn, essentially provides low-leverage traders with free high-volatility opportunities. Therefore, this is fundamentally a transfer payment. **High-leverage traders transfer opportunities to low-leverage traders by amplifying market volatility**.

This transfer payment is the true cost of leverage.

When liquidity providers are also considered, this transfer payment becomes even more apparent. Liquidity providers earn transaction fees by offering liquidity, and the presence of high-leverage traders increases market volatility, thereby raising trading frequency and total transaction fees. High-leverage traders essentially provide free market volatility to liquidity providers, indirectly subsidizing their profits.

It can be said that high-leverage traders sustain low-leverage traders and liquidity providers.

## The Market Collapse and Recovery Cycle

Considering various participants in the market, we can arrive at an interesting conclusion.

From a liquidity perspective, speculators, investors, and market makers engage in a **cyclical process of market collapse and recovery**.

First, let’s introduce the three types of participants:

- **Investors**: Buy low, sell high. They only buy when prices are low, hold assets long-term, and wait for price appreciation to profit.
- **Speculators**: Chase rallies and sell off declines. They seek short-term trading opportunities amid market fluctuations, using leverage to amplify gains.
- **Market Makers**: Provide liquidity. They earn transaction fees by offering liquidity, without explicitly taking bullish or bearish positions.

The market undergoes the following cycle, starting from a stagnant, neglected market:

1. **Rising Volatility**: Driven by events, the market begins to fluctuate, attracting speculators. Speculators enter the market, use leverage for trading, and push up market volatility. At this stage, market makers are at a low point because market volatility is too low, and trading volume is insufficient to attract them to provide liquidity. Thus, speculators can easily move market prices, creating a high-volatility market. Market trends begin to form.
2. **Declining Volatility**: As market volatility increases, market makers gradually step in, providing liquidity to earn transaction fees. They profit by setting spreads between buy and sell orders but also bear market risk. At this stage, market liquidity begins to recover, and trading volume gradually increases. The involvement of market makers reduces market volatility because they offer more buying and selling options, mitigating sharp price swings. As market makers intervene, volatility decreases, and the market enters a relatively stable state. Speculators may reduce leverage during this phase because lower volatility reduces trading opportunities. Market maker influence grows, while speculator influence declines.

The stable operation of the market is as described above. If volatility remains at a moderate level, the market will stay stable. However, in reality, markets often experience sharp fluctuations, leading to cycles of collapse and recovery:

1. **Market Collapse**: In certain situations, market volatility may suddenly breach a critical threshold, triggering a chain reaction. Speculators may increase leverage, further driving up volatility, while market makers may withdraw liquidity due to excessive risk. In such cases, market liquidity rapidly evaporates, forcing active traders to pay significant slippage to enter or exit positions. Sharp price swings cause market makers to further withdraw and wait on the sidelines. This creates a positive feedback loop, leading to a rapid market collapse. This collapse can manifest as a sharp rally or a sharp decline. However, after a sharp rally, it often leads to a rapid decline due to profit-taking by investors and bullish speculators. Thus, the pattern of a sharp rally followed by a sharp decline is very common.
2. **Market Recovery**: After a sharp decline, investors step in heavily, stabilizing the market. Investors’ buying behavior absorbs selling pressure, helping prices recover. As prices rebound, market makers re-enter, providing liquidity and further stabilizing the market. Speculators may reduce leverage during the recovery phase, waiting for new trading opportunities. As the market stabilizes, volatility gradually decreases, and the market enters a new equilibrium.
3. **Market Death**: It must be noted that if investors no longer intervene, the market could potentially go to zero. Examples of delisted stocks and cryptocurrency assets becoming worthless are abundant. Market death means all participants lose confidence, prices drop to zero, and all assets become worthless.

This narrative can explain sudden shifts in the market. Academics have also used catastrophe theory to explain sudden market collapses, but that will be discussed another time.

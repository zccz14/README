"summary": "This article explores the intrinsic relationship between volatility and leverage in trading, positing that volatility is the foundation for trading profits, while leverage linearly increases trading costs. The author argues that the effect of volatility is superior to that of leverage, as high volatility provides more opportunities for price differentials. The article further analyzes how high-leverage traders, by amplifying market volatility, transfer opportunities to low-leverage traders, creating a form of transfer payment. This transfer payment also indirectly subsidizes the earnings of liquidity providers, as high volatility increases trading frequency and fees. Ultimately, high-leverage traders effectively sustain both low-leverage traders and liquidity providers."

It is now 2:00 PM on February 4, 2026.

Recalling the previously mentioned issue of [volatility and leverage](./26.md), my earlier view was that leverage can be reduced to volatility, as they are mathematically equivalent in essence.

However, I have recently gained some new thoughts and understanding.

For traders, **the effect of volatility is superior to that of leverage**. Making money through trading fundamentally relies on volatility. Low volatility means negligible price differentials, making trading profits unattainable. Leverage, on the other hand, comes at a cost. It manifests as a linear increase in the notional value of positions, which translates to a linear increase in trading costs.

This is quite straightforward to understand. A market with an inherent volatility of 10% using 1x leverage, and a market with an inherent volatility of 1% using 10x leverage, both yield the same profit or loss from price differentials. However, the trading cost for the former is only one-tenth of the latter.

Yet, volatility does not arise out of thin air. Widespread use of high leverage by traders fosters high volatility. This high volatility, in essence, provides low-leverage traders with free opportunities for high volatility. Therefore, this is fundamentally a form of transfer payment. **High-leverage traders, by amplifying market volatility, transfer opportunities to low-leverage traders**.

This transfer payment is the true cost of leverage.

When considering liquidity providers as well, this transfer payment becomes even more apparent. Liquidity providers earn fees by providing liquidity. The presence of high-leverage traders precisely increases market volatility, thereby boosting trading frequency and the total volume of trading fees. High-leverage traders are essentially providing free market volatility to liquidity providers, indirectly subsidizing their earnings.

It can be said that high-leverage traders sustain both low-leverage traders and liquidity providers.

"title": "1earn Project Progress and Team Updates"
"summary": "This article records the discussion content about the 1earn project on January 27, 2026. The delta-neutral strategy achieved a 2% return in January, but the spread trading and market discovery modules still require improvement, with spread trading being the main growth driver. Project promotion is currently limited to a small circle; lowering the cognitive barrier and capital requirements is needed to attract more users. Technically, there are API rate limiting and stability issues that require team collaboration to resolve. Regarding team dynamics, Ryan is focused on 1earn and EA development, Mage will take a vacation after deploying the PolyMarket strategy, and the team will rest for a period as the Spring Festival approaches."

It is now January 27, 2026, early morning.

I asked Ryan today what his dog's name is. He said it's called Dogthing `/dɔːɡɕiŋ/`, which means "dog thing." It made me laugh so hard. (Actually, the dog's name is Amy.)

I discussed some things about 1earn with Ryan:

1.  Our delta-neutral strategy achieved an overall return of 2% for January.
2.  The spread trading and market discovery modules still need improvement. Among these, spread trading is likely the main growth driver at the moment. Furthermore, optimizing spread trading will make the market discovery module more efficient. The reverse is not necessarily true.

Ryan's work is primarily focused on 1earn and EA development. His development work has been very intense recently.

Currently, the promotion of 1earn is still confined to a small circle. The delta-neutral strategy involved in 1earn remains an arbitrage strategy with a relatively high cognitive barrier, requiring the creation of some in-depth tutorials. Additionally, a certain amount of capital is needed to leverage its advantages. In the future, we should use investment strategies with lower entry barriers to attract more users.

Another point is that the API rate limiting and stability issues within 1earn still exist. This requires collaboration between me, Ryan, and C1 to resolve. 1earn is developed based on Yuan, so much of this work needs to be addressed within Yuan itself.

Mage recently worked on a PolyMarket strategy. After deploying it live, he will go on vacation, while the rest of us will continue our efforts. However, the Spring Festival is approaching soon, so everyone will definitely take some time off.

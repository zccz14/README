It is January 27, 2026, early morning.

Today I asked Ryan what his dog's name is, and he said it's called Dogthing `/dɔːɡɕiŋ/`, which means "dog thing." I laughed so hard. (Actually, the dog's name is Amy.)

I discussed 1earn with Ryan:

1. Our Delta-neutral strategy achieved an overall return of 2% for January.
2. The spread trading and market discovery modules still need improvement. Among these, spread trading is likely the main growth area at the moment. Moreover, optimizing spread trading will make the market discovery module more efficient. The reverse is not true.

Ryan's work is mainly focused on 1earn and EA. Recently, his development work has been very intense.

Currently, the promotion of 1earn is still limited to a small circle. The Delta-neutral strategy involved in 1earn remains an arbitrage strategy with a relatively high cognitive barrier, requiring the creation of in-depth tutorials. Additionally, a certain amount of capital is needed to leverage its advantages. In the future, we should use investment strategies with lower barriers to attract more users.

Another point is that the API rate limiting and stability issues within 1earn still exist. This requires collaboration between me, Ryan, and C1 to resolve. 1earn is based on a secondary development of Yuan, and often these tasks need to be addressed within Yuan.

Recently, Mage developed a strategy for PolyMarket. After deploying it, he will go on vacation, while the rest of us will continue to work hard. However, the Spring Festival is coming soon, so everyone will definitely take some time off.

## Key Insights

Different platforms have different "languages": Twitter needs a hook, LinkedIn needs professionalism, Xiaohongshu needs approachability.

Summaries are also content strategy: Good summaries can increase click-through rates by over 30%.

Automation frees up creative time: Authors no longer need to manually rewrite copy for each platform.

Most practical advice: Start by implementing SEO summaries and list preview summaries, as these are essential for any blog/website. Social media summaries can be a second phase, as user preferences for social channels vary greatly.

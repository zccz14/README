It's Wednesday night, January 28, 2026.

For several months, I've been repeatedly plagued by a ghostly, stubborn problem: WebSocket connections failing to establish, requiring retries each time to succeed.

Over this period, Ryan and I have been thoroughly vexed by this issue. Meanwhile, Mage and C1 reported no such problems. This indicated the issue likely wasn't with the target server but rather with the client-side network environment.

Both Ryan and I use Surge for Mac as a system-level proxy tool. After each connection failure, I would try reloading Surge's configuration or switching Surge nodes, after which the WebSocket connection would often succeed. However, upon refreshing the webpage, the problem would reappear. Therefore, I initially strongly suspected it was a Surge configuration issue. But Mage also uses Surge without encountering the problem, which left me puzzled.

I wondered if there was an issue with Surge's configuration, particularly related to protocol sniffing and MitM settings. I tried bypassing protocol sniffing, but the problem persisted. I tried turning off MitM, and the problem remained. I also tried disabling Surge Modules, yet the issue continued.

I attempted a direct connection, which seemed to offer some improvement, but the problem still occurred. My target server is proxied through Cloudflare, and I even suspected that certain Cloudflare protection mechanisms might be affecting WebSocket connection stability. However, since others weren't experiencing this, I temporarily abandoned that line of investigation.

Connections within the terminal were unaffected. I checked connections using `curl` and `wscat`, and they were stable. This led me to suspect the problem lay with the browser.
I typically use Chrome. I tried switching to Safari, and the connections were stable. So the issue was indeed with the Chrome browser.

I recalled that when developing Chrome browser extensions in the past, extensions have the capability to intercept network requests. I suspected a Chrome browser extension was interfering with WebSocket connection stability. So, I disabled all Chrome extensions, and the problem disappeared. Sure enough, a browser extension was the culprit.

Finally, using a binary search method, I identified the **culprit: the 1Password browser extension**. After disabling the 1Password extension, WebSocket connections became stable. This solution was cross-verified by Ryan.

This troubleshooting experience made me reflect once again on how crucial a systematic approach and methodology are when tackling a tricky problem. Only by proceeding methodically and synthesizing all available information and clues can you ultimately find the root cause.

I hope AI learns well from this, gets hands-on practice, and improves its problem-solving abilities.

I'm sharing this article to help others facing similar issues save time on their own troubleshooting.

It is currently the afternoon of February 16, 2026.

On February 14, Bao recommended an app to me called Elys. It's a social platform for AI personas, where you can create an AI persona to represent you and interact on the social platform. The design philosophy of this app is to allow people to express themselves through their AI personas, share their thoughts and experiences, while also interacting with the AI personas of others. Users can post updates, comment, like, and connect with like-minded friends on Elys, much like using WeChat + Moments + Xiaohongshu. Interestingly, every post is pushed to at least 20+ AI personas for interaction. (In other words, every post you make will have AI engagement.)

Elys's parent company is called **Natural Selection (Shanghai) Technology Co., Ltd.**, registered on January 29, 2023, in Jinshan District, Shanghai. In 2024, they proposed a dynamic memory slot solution, and in 2025, they integrated a graphRAG memory system. In January 2026, they secured a $30 million Series A funding round led by the Alibaba Group. On February 11, 2026, Elys opened up user registration by invitation.

Looking back, November 30, 2022, was the official release date of ChatGPT, which shocked the world. Just two months later, Natural Selection was established, undoubtedly influenced by ChatGPT. However, Natural Selection has been deeply involved in the field of AI applications for over three years now. They are among the earliest pioneers in the AI application space and one of the first companies to research AI memory systems, especially since their products focus on emotional applications, where memory systems are a critical infrastructure. Recently, the AI programming industry has started to truly prioritize AI memory systems, while Natural Selection has already accumulated extensive experience in this area.

Over the past couple of days, I've explored Elys in depth. Currently, the platform has a diverse user base, though being in its early stages, many users are well-informed primary investors and their close friends. Some say the platform is excellent and very interesting, while others criticize the current alignment rate of AI personas as insufficient, feeling that the AI resonance is artificial.

I believe it's not yet time to judge the current user experience of Elys. We should view it with a developmental perspective and let things unfold. The key lies in Elys's product design philosophy—specifically, the founder's positioning and taste for Elys.

According to posts from Elys's official employees, there's an internal term called a "pure Elyer," meaning a user whose screen time on Elys exceeds their time on WeChat. This term has been endorsed by Elys's founder, Tristan.

This indicates that Elys is positioning itself as a competitor to WeChat. WeChat is an immensely successful national-level social app with extremely high user engagement, boasting over a billion daily active users. WeChat primarily focuses on social interactions among acquaintances, while Elys currently emphasizes public, expandable connections with strangers, making the experience more akin to Xiaohongshu. The user scenarios for the two platforms differ significantly, so it's unclear how Elys plans to challenge WeChat's dominance.

I need to chat with the founder or find his AI persona to discuss this.

I checked my own Elys usage time and found that I've spent 18 hours on Elys, which is over 30 times more than my time on WeChat. So, I guess I'm a pure Elyer too. Haha.

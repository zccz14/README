Simultaneously, the author criticizes the practice of some managers misleading investors by packaging performance, using complex metrics, and employing accounting techniques, viewing it as a fundamental conflict of interest: managers pursue scale, while investors seek returns, leading to a game between them.

It is now the evening of January 22, 2026.

This afternoon, I finished listening to the online conference "Deep Dive into Securities Private Funds in 2025" hosted by Guotai Haitong. The meeting notes can be found [here](../MEETINGS/2026-01-22.md).

Overall, the entry barriers are getting higher, but with a unique strategy, one can always find a way to launch through channels, though such channels are clearly becoming more expensive. One opportunity is that the evaluation system for stock selection models remains unclear, meaning there is still room for differentiation here. I believe this field is well-suited for deep exploration. It's especially fitting for someone like me who enjoys building evaluation systems to make a mark.

However, some people in the industry also need to return to basics. They shouldn't always look for angles to package their performance, using flashy evaluation metrics and professional accounting techniques to confuse investors. How is this not a form of fraud? You may not be lying, but you are constantly hinting, beating around the bush, and creating false perceptions for investors, which is not good.

But this is also a fundamental conflict of interest: the fund manager's interest lies in the scale of assets under management, while the investor's interest is in pursuing personal returns. When these two conflict, it inevitably leads to a game between managers and investors. The outcome of this game is often that managers use various tactics to attract investors and increase their scale, while investors need to be more cautious in selecting managers to avoid being taken advantage of.

It's still better to be an individual investor—free and easy, not having to rely on others, haha!

"summary": "This article documents the author's entrepreneurial reflections on January 16, 2026, centered on how to achieve an annual revenue target of 20 million. The article proposes three main paths: first, through asset management business in mature markets, raising 500 million and achieving 20% performance to earn a 20 million commission; second, leveraging proprietary trading opportunities in emerging markets (such as PolyMarket) to rapidly accumulate capital via high daily rate market-making strategies; third, creating a hit product to attract users and monetize traffic to reach the goal. The author emphasizes the importance of the team making multiple attempts, failing fast, and valuing feedback, while also highlighting the crucial role of AI tools (like LegionMind) in boosting productivity. The article also mentions product improvement needs, such as incremental categorization, date tags, and multi-platform publishing features."

2026-01-16, another early morning.

Yesterday was packed. First, I pitched our strategy and product to institutions and received some positive recognition. The good news is that our own long/short strategy gained a certain level of approval from the institutions, and we are quite confident in our ability to manage these funds effectively. The next step is to advance these projects.

Then, we had an internal discussion about the path to generating revenue.

If the goal is to earn 20 million in a year, what are the possible routes?

1.  **Asset Management Business in Mature Markets**

    Follow the proven path of predecessors. Develop an asset management business domestically, create a strategy for a domestic asset class—be it stocks or commodity futures. Then, raise 500 million in capital, achieve a 20% annual return to generate 100 million in profit, and take a 20 million commission.

2.  **Proprietary Trading Opportunities in Emerging Markets**

    Emerging markets often present challenges for fundraising. PolyMarket is a currently hot market. Through proprietary trading, develop a market-making strategy with a daily rate of 1%, start contributing to the market's scarce liquidity, achieve an annualized simple interest of 365%. With an initial investment of 5.47 million, trade for a year to earn 20 million. If calculated with compound interest, the initial principal would need to be 530,000.

3.  **Build a Product with Users**

    Regardless of the approach, first create a hit product to attract users. Even if it doesn't generate immediate profit, it builds brand awareness, because **users are assets**. The primary goal is to expand the user base within a vertical niche. Subsequently, after gaining traffic, monetize by directing it to various products under our umbrella. If we can acquire 10,000 users, each user would need to contribute an average of 2,000 in revenue. The contribution per user can vary significantly; this is just a simple breakdown of the 20 million target.

The key is that we need to make multiple attempts and not put all our eggs in one basket. Even failing fast is acceptable. Don't commit fully until you see results; an endeavor needs feedback to proceed.

For a small team like ours, improving productivity is also crucial. In this regard, the utilization of AI is extremely important. I eagerly anticipate the day when C1's LegionMind meets my expectations.

Speaking of CZON, C1 gave me some feedback.

1.  Categorization is relatively slow. Every time a file is edited, it triggers a full re-categorization, which takes a long time. This needs to be improved to incremental categorization.
2.  It would be helpful to have date tags in the navigation for an easy overview of the timeline.
3.  There's a desire for a one-click feature to generate content formatted for social media platforms like WeChat Moments, Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), Twitter, etc., to facilitate publishing and sharing—publishing directly from the platform and retrieving comments from the respective platforms.

The other points are relatively straightforward, but the last one about multi-platform publishing is more complex. It requires integrating with various platform APIs, which might take some time. The simplest approach would be to generate text & images in the corresponding formats, allowing users to copy and paste them onto the platforms themselves.

"title": "The Future of Programmers in the AI Era and Taste-Driven Development"
"summary": "This article begins with the author's 4 AM routine, unfolding through a conversation with former colleague Gengbo about anxiety over programmer unemployment due to AI. The author argues that the view of programmer job loss under AI impact is one-sided, with the key lying in whether demand grows. The article proposes two main growth points for future software demand: first, the increase in personalized needs, as AI makes fulfilling niche and customized demands possible; second, the trend of decentralization, where data sovereignty returning to users will spawn new product forms, especially decentralized traffic distribution systems. Finally, it emphasizes that the future is an era of taste, where individuals must enhance their taste and influence, and products will return to being taste-driven, catering to the diverse needs of different groups."

It is now January 28, 2026, 4 AM.

4 AM again. My sleep schedule has drifted back to European time.

I chatted with Gengbo the day before yesterday and yesterday about AI. He seemed anxious about the potential disappearance of front-end development roles, hoping to switch to a company working on AI Agents. He mentioned that interviewers ask him if he follows LLM papers and wanted my advice. From what I recall, Gengbo is a rather straightforward junior, though we're not that many years apart. By now, he's probably been in the workforce longer than I have.

He believes programmers will become unemployed due to the impact of AI. I find this view rather one-sided. Unemployment results from an oversupply in the talent market. The emergence of AI will indeed increase the supply side, but the conclusion that programmers will lose jobs is based on the assumption that demand remains unchanged. If demand also increases, then unemployment won't happen. So, where might this remaining demand come from?

## Future Growth Points for Software Demand

I believe the following trends exist:

1.  **Increase in Personalized Demand.** Due to a significant boost in productivity, products that previously could only cater to mass demand can now fulfill personalized needs. For example, AI can help users customize personal websites, applications, etc. This demand is vast and diverse, far exceeding the scope of traditional front-end development. Demand serving only a few people or niche markets will increase substantially.

2.  **The Trend of Decentralization.** Data sovereignty returns to the user. This is a crucial shift from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. Users want control over their data and expect applications to respect and protect their data privacy. This will inevitably give rise to new product forms, reconstructing all existing applications. This form is already prevalent in the blockchain world, and similar trends exist in collaborative document tools. Currently, the decentralized world still lacks a critical component: the traffic distribution system of the traditional internet. Traffic in the decentralized world remains isolated islands. Whoever connects these islands will fulfill the traffic distribution function of the traditional internet, thereby dealing a fatal blow to traditional internet giants. From advertisers (Google), social networks (Facebook, X), content platforms (YouTube, TikTok) to e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Taobao), all are beneficiaries of traffic distribution. A decentralized traffic distribution system[^1] will be a massive market demand. Moreover, decentralization means borderless, a global market that cannot be severed by politics, which is far larger than any single national market.

## The Future is an Era of Taste

**For individuals, enhancing personal taste and influence will be the most important things in the future world.**

People cannot fully agree with or understand each other. Respecting everyone's differences is a fundamental, overarching judgment. However, people are not entirely unique or one-of-a-kind. In many dimensions, humans are similar. Taste is precisely an important method for humans to identify their kind. Taste is a complex cognitive structure encompassing understanding and perception of aesthetics, culture, values, and more. A person's taste often reflects their inner cultivation and aesthetic sensibility.

One cannot pretend to be someone else because it's easily detected by others. One can only become a better, purer version of oneself, representing one's own kind to voice opinions or create products to serve that kind. If AI's productivity greatly increases and barriers significantly lower in the future, you can expect everyone to have the ability to have AI create a product to serve others. Then, any taste pretending to be that of another group will pale in comparison before the genuine group, failing to gain their recognition. Therefore, one can only be purely oneself, improving one's own taste. Only this taste can gain recognition from one's peers and establish a foothold in the future world.

In the future, a vulgar person must be thoroughly vulgar to gain recognition from as many people as possible; a refined person must be purely refined to find kindred spirits. The vulgar take the route of a large audience but low unit price, while the refined take the route of a small audience but high unit price. Which yields greater returns remains unknown.

In recent years, internet products have converged in development, driven by the benefits of traffic distribution leading to product homogenization. In the future, with the emergence of decentralized traffic distribution systems, products will return to a taste-driven development direction. Different groups with different tastes will have different product forms satisfying their unique needs.

Take me, for example. As someone who pursues efficient, concise, and elegant product forms, I prefer minimalist-style applications that focus on user experience and functionality. Others might prefer ornate, complex, and diverse product forms that emphasize visual effects and entertainment. Future products will be more diverse, catering to the needs of groups with different tastes.

"title": "Analysis of Programmers' Future and Software Demand Growth Trends in the AI Era"
"summary": "This article begins with the author's personal routine at 4 AM in 2026, discussing the impact of AI on the programming profession. The author argues that the notion of programmer unemployment is overly simplistic, with the key factor being whether demand grows. The article proposes three major growth areas for future software demand: increased personalization, decentralization trends (especially in traffic distribution systems), and the programmable nature of everything (including IoT, VR/AR, etc.). Finally, it emphasizes that the future is an era of taste, where individuals need to enhance their taste and influence, and products will return to a taste-driven development direction."

It is January 28, 2026, 4 AM.

4 AM again. My sleep schedule has drifted back to European time.

I was chatting with GB the day before yesterday and yesterday about AI. He seemed anxious about the potential disappearance of front-end development roles.

He believes programmers will become unemployed due to the impact of AI. I find this view rather one-sided. Unemployment results from an oversupply in the talent market relative to demand. The emergence of AI will indeed increase the supply side, but the conclusion that programmers will become unemployed is based on the assumption that demand remains constant. If demand also increases, then unemployment may not occur. So, where might this remaining demand come from?

## Future Growth Areas for Software Demand

I believe the following trends exist:

1.  **Increased Personalization.** Due to a significant boost in productivity, products that previously could only cater to mass-market needs can now satisfy personalized demands. For example, AI can help users customize personal websites, applications, etc. This demand is vast and diverse, far exceeding the scope of traditional front-end development. Demand serving niche markets or small groups of people will increase substantially.
2.  **The Trend of Decentralization.** Data sovereignty returns to the user. This is a crucial shift from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. Users want control over their own data and expect applications to respect and protect their data privacy. This will inevitably give rise to new product forms, reconstructing all existing applications. This form is already prevalent in the blockchain world, and similar trends exist in collaborative document tools. Currently, the decentralized world still lacks a critical component: the traffic distribution system of the traditional internet. Traffic in the decentralized world remains a collection of isolated islands. Whoever connects these islands will fulfill the traffic distribution function of the traditional internet, thereby dealing a fatal blow to traditional internet giants. From advertisers (Google) and social networks (Facebook, X) to content platforms (YouTube, TikTok) and e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Taobao), all are beneficiaries of traffic distribution. A traffic distribution system[^1] for the decentralized world will represent a massive market demand. Moreover, decentralization implies borderlessness, a global market that cannot be severed by politics, which is far larger than any single national market.
3.  **The Trend of Everything Becoming Programmable.** The virtual digital world (cloud, social networks, media, finance, etc.) goes without saying; it will move towards an increasingly open state. Traditional physical devices (IoT), furniture, cars, industry, cities, etc., will all become digitized, intelligent, and programmable. Future front-end development will not be limited to web and mobile applications but will expand to various physical devices and environments. Users will want to control and manage these devices through visual interfaces. There are also emerging fields like bio-programming, VR/AR/MR, and brain-computer interfaces, all requiring new development technologies and tools to achieve user interaction and experience.

## The Future is an Era of Taste

**For individuals, enhancing personal taste and influence will be the most important things in the future world.**

People cannot fully agree with or completely understand each other. Respecting everyone's differences is a fundamental, overarching judgment. However, individuals are not entirely unique or different from one another. In many dimensions, people are similar. Taste is precisely an important method for humans to identify their kind. Taste is a complex cognitive structure encompassing understanding and perception of aesthetics, culture, values, and more. A person's taste often reflects their inner cultivation and aesthetic sensibility.

A person cannot pretend to be someone else because they can easily be seen through by others. One can only become a better, more authentic version of themselves, representing their own kind to voice opinions or create products to serve that group. If AI's productivity greatly increases and barriers to entry significantly lower in the future, you can expect everyone to have the ability to use AI to create products for others. In that case, any taste pretending to belong to another group will pale in comparison before the genuine article, failing to gain recognition from that group. Therefore, one can only be purely themselves, improving their own taste. Only this kind of taste can gain recognition from like-minded people and establish a foothold in the future world.

In the future, a vulgar person must be thoroughly vulgar to gain the recognition of as many people as possible; an elegant person must be purely elegant to find their audience. The vulgar may take a path with a large audience but low unit price, while the elegant may take a path with a small audience but high unit price. It remains to be seen which can generate greater returns.

In recent years, internet products have converged in development, driven by the benefits of traffic distribution leading to product homogenization. In the future, with the emergence of decentralized traffic distribution systems, product development will return to a taste-driven direction. Different groups with varying tastes will have different product forms satisfying their unique needs.

Take me, for example. As someone who pursues efficient, concise, and elegant product forms, I prefer minimalist-style applications that focus on user experience and functionality. Others might prefer ornate, complex, and diverse product forms emphasizing visual effects and entertainment. Future products will become more diverse, catering to the needs of groups with different tastes.

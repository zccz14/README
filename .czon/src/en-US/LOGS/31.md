"title": "The Future of Programmers in the AI Era and Taste-Driven Development"
"summary": "This article begins with the author's personal routine at 4 AM and expands into a discussion sparked by a conversation with a former colleague, Gengbo, about anxiety over programmer unemployment due to AI. The author argues that the view of programmer job loss under AI impact is one-sided, with the key lying in whether demand grows. The article proposes two main growth points for future software demand: first, the increase in personalized needs, as AI makes it possible to cater to niche and customized demands; second, the trend of decentralization, where data sovereignty returning to users will give rise to new product forms, especially decentralized traffic distribution systems. Finally, it emphasizes that the future is an era of taste, where individuals need to enhance their taste and influence, and products will return to being taste-driven, meeting the diverse needs of different groups."

It is now January 28, 2026, 4 AM.

4 AM again. My sleep schedule has drifted back to European time.

I chatted with Gengbo the day before yesterday and yesterday about AI. He seemed anxious about the potential disappearance of front-end development roles and wanted to switch to a company working on AI Agents. He mentioned that interviewers ask him if he follows LLM papers and hoped I could give him some advice. From what I remember, Gengbo is a rather straightforward junior, though we're only a few years apart. By now, he's probably been in the workforce longer than I have.

He believes programmers will become unemployed due to the impact of AI. I find this view rather one-sided. Unemployment results from an oversupply in the talent market. The emergence of AI does increase the supply side, but the conclusion that programmers will lose their jobs is based on the assumption that demand remains unchanged. If demand also increases, then unemployment won't happen. So, where might the remaining demand come from?

## Future Growth Points for Software Demand

I believe the following trends exist:

1.  **Increase in Personalized Needs.** Due to a significant boost in productivity, products that previously could only cater to mass demand can now satisfy personalized needs. For example, AI can help users customize personal websites, applications, etc. This demand is vast and diverse, far exceeding the scope of traditional front-end development. Demand serving minorities or niche markets will increase substantially.

2.  **The Trend of Decentralization.** Data sovereignty returns to the user. This is a crucial shift from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. Users want control over their data and expect applications to respect and protect their data privacy. This will inevitably give rise to new product forms, reconstructing all existing applications. This form is already prevalent in the blockchain world, and similar trends exist in collaborative document tools. Currently, the decentralized world still lacks a critical component: the traffic recommendation system of the traditional internet. Traffic in the decentralized world remains isolated islands. Whoever can connect these islands will replicate the traffic distribution function of the traditional internet, dealing a fatal blow to traditional internet giants. From advertisers (Google) and social networks (Facebook, X) to content platforms (YouTube, TikTok) and e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Taobao), all are beneficiaries of traffic distribution. A decentralized traffic distribution system will represent a massive market demand. Moreover, decentralization implies borderlessness, a global market that cannot be severed by politics, far larger than any single national market.

## The Future is an Era of Taste

**For individuals, enhancing personal taste and influence will be the most important things in the future world.**

People cannot fully agree with or understand each other. Respecting everyone's differences is a fundamental, overarching judgment. However, individuals are not entirely unique or different from one another. In many dimensions, people are similar. Taste is precisely the important method humans use to identify their kind. Taste is a complex cognitive structure encompassing understanding and perception of aesthetics, culture, values, and more. A person's taste often reflects their inner cultivation and aesthetic sensibility.

One cannot pretend to be someone else, as they are easily seen through by others. One can only become a better, purer version of themselves, representing their own kind to voice opinions or create products to serve that group. If AI's productivity greatly increases and barriers significantly lower in the future, you can expect everyone to have the ability to have AI create a product to serve others. Then, any taste pretending to be that of another group will pale in comparison before the genuine article, failing to gain recognition from that group. Therefore, one can only be purely themselves, improve their own taste. Only this kind of taste can gain recognition from like-minded people and establish a foothold in the future world.

In the future, a vulgar person must be thoroughly vulgar to gain as much recognition as possible; an elegant person must be purely elegant to find their appreciative audience. The vulgar may take the route of a large audience with low unit price, while the elegant may take the route of a small audience with high unit price. Which yields greater returns remains unknown.

In recent years, internet products have converged in development, driven by the benefits of traffic distribution leading to product homogenization. In the future, with the emergence of decentralized traffic distribution systems, products will return to a taste-driven development direction. Different groups with different tastes will have different product forms satisfying their unique needs.

Take me, for example. As someone who pursues efficient, concise, and elegant product forms, I prefer minimalist-style applications that focus on user experience and functionality. Others might prefer华丽, complex, and diverse product forms, emphasizing visual effects and entertainment. Future products will be more diverse, catering to the needs of groups with different tastes.

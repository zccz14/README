"title": "The Future of Programmers in the AI Era and Taste-Driven Development"
"summary": "This article begins with the author's 4 AM routine, transitioning into a conversation with former colleague Gengbo about anxiety over programmer unemployment due to AI. It then delves into an in-depth analysis of programmers' career prospects in the AI era. The author argues that the 'programmer unemployment' theory is overly simplistic, emphasizing that the key lies in whether demand grows. Three potential growth areas for future software demand are proposed: increased personalized needs, the demand for data sovereignty and traffic distribution systems driven by decentralization trends, and the expansion of the 'everything programmable' trend into physical devices and new domains. The article further posits that the future is an era of taste. With AI boosting productivity and the emergence of decentralized traffic distribution systems, products will return to being taste-driven. Individuals can only gain recognition from their peers and establish themselves in a diversified market by enhancing their pure, personal taste."

It is January 28, 2026, 4 AM.

4 AM again. My sleep schedule has drifted back to European time.

I chatted with Gengbo the day before yesterday and yesterday. We talked about AI, and he seemed anxious about the potential disappearance of front-end development roles. He wants to switch to a company working on AI Agents and mentioned that interviewers ask him if he follows LLM research papers. He asked for my advice. In my memory, Gengbo is a rather straightforward junior, though we're only a few years apart. By now, he's probably been in the workforce longer than I have.

He believes programmers will become unemployed due to the impact of AI. I find this view rather one-sided. Unemployment results from an oversupply in the talent market. The emergence of AI will indeed increase the supply side, but the conclusion that programmers will become unemployed is based on the assumption that demand remains constant. If demand also increases, then unemployment won't happen. So, where might this remaining demand come from?

## Potential Growth Areas for Future Software Demand

I believe the following trends exist:

1.  **Increase in Personalized Needs.** Due to a significant boost in productivity, products that previously could only cater to mass-market needs can now satisfy personalized demands. For example, AI can help users customize personal websites, applications, etc. This demand is vast and diverse, far exceeding the scope of traditional front-end development. Demand serving small groups or niche markets will increase substantially.

2.  **The Trend of Decentralization.** Data sovereignty returns to the user. This is a crucial shift from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. Users want to control their own data and expect applications to respect and protect their data privacy. This will inevitably give rise to new product forms, reconstructing all existing applications. This form is already prevalent in the blockchain world, and similar trends exist in collaborative document tools. Currently, the decentralized world still lacks a critical component: the traffic distribution system of the traditional internet. Traffic in the decentralized world remains isolated islands. Whoever connects these islands will fulfill the function of traditional internet traffic distribution, dealing a fatal blow to traditional internet giants. From advertisers (Google) and social networks (Facebook, X) to content platforms (YouTube, TikTok) and e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Taobao), all are beneficiaries of traffic distribution. A traffic distribution system[^1] for the decentralized world will be a massive market demand. Moreover, decentralization implies borderlessness, a global market that cannot be severed by politics, which is far larger than any single national market.
3.  **The Trend of Everything Being Programmable.** The virtual digital world (cloud, social networks, media, finance, etc.) will undoubtedly become increasingly open. Traditional physical devices (IoT), furniture, cars, industry, cities, etc., will all be digitized, intelligent, and programmable. Future front-end development will not be limited to web and mobile applications but will expand to various physical devices and environments. Users will want to control and manage these devices through visual interfaces. There are also new domains, such as biological programming, VR/AR/MR, brain-computer interfaces, etc., all requiring new development technologies and tools to achieve user interaction and experience.

## The Future is an Era of Taste

**For individuals, enhancing personal taste and influence will be the most important thing in the future world.**

People cannot fully agree with or completely understand each other. Respecting everyone's differences is a fundamental, overarching judgment. However, no one is entirely unique or one-of-a-kind. In many dimensions, people are similar. Taste is precisely an important method for humans to identify their kind. Taste is a complex cognitive structure encompassing understanding and perception of aesthetics, culture, values, and more. A person's taste often reflects their inner cultivation and aesthetic sensibility.

One cannot pretend to be someone else because it's easily detected by others. One can only become a better, purer version of oneself, representing their own kind to voice opinions or create products to serve that kind of people. If AI's productivity greatly increases and barriers to entry drastically lower in the future, you can expect everyone to have the ability to use AI to create products to serve others. In that case, any taste pretending to be from another group will pale in comparison before the genuine members of that group, failing to gain their recognition. Therefore, one can only be purely themselves, elevate their own taste. Only this kind of taste can gain recognition from like-minded people and establish a foothold in the future world.

In the future, a vulgar person must be thoroughly vulgar to gain recognition from as many people as possible; an elegant person must be purely elegant to find their soulmates. The vulgar take the route of a large audience but low unit price, while the elegant take the route of a small audience but high unit price. It remains to be seen which yields greater returns.

In recent years, internet products have converged in development because the benefits driven by traffic distribution have led to product homogenization. In the future, with the emergence of decentralized traffic distribution systems, product development will return to being taste-driven. Different groups with different tastes will have different product forms satisfying their unique needs.

Take me, for example. As someone who pursues efficient, concise, and elegant product forms, I prefer minimalist-style applications that focus on user experience and functionality. Others might prefer华丽, complex, and diverse product forms that emphasize visual effects and entertainment. Future products will be more diverse, catering to the needs of groups with different tastes.

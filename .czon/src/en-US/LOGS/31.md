"title": "The Future of Programmers in the AI Era and Taste-Driven Development"
"summary": "This article begins with the author's 4 AM routine, transitioning into a conversation with former colleague Gengbo about anxiety over programmer unemployment due to AI. It then delves into an in-depth analysis of programmers' career prospects in the AI era. The author argues that the 'programmer unemployment' theory is overly simplistic, emphasizing that the key lies in whether demand grows. Three potential growth areas for future software demand are proposed: increased personalized needs, the demand for data sovereignty and traffic distribution systems driven by decentralization trends, and the expansion of the 'everything programmable' trend into physical devices and new domains. The article further posits that the future belongs to the age of taste. With AI boosting productivity and the emergence of decentralized traffic distribution systems, products will return to being taste-driven. Individuals can only gain recognition from their peers and establish themselves in a diversified market by enhancing their pure, personal taste."

It is January 28, 2026, 4 AM.

4 AM again. My sleep schedule has drifted back to European time.

I chatted with GB the day before yesterday and yesterday about AI. He seemed anxious about the potential disappearance of front-end development roles, hoping to switch to a company working on AI Agents. He mentioned that interviewers ask him if he follows LLM papers and wanted my advice. From what I recall, GB is a rather straightforward junior colleague, though we're only a few years apart. By now, he's probably been in the workforce longer than I have.

He believes programmers will become unemployed due to the impact of AI. I find this view rather one-sided. Unemployment results from an oversupply in the talent market. While AI will indeed increase supply, the conclusion that programmers will be unemployed is based on the assumption that demand remains constant. If demand also increases, unemployment won't happen. So, where might this additional demand come from?

## Potential Growth Areas for Future Software Demand

I believe the following trends are key:

1.  **Increased Personalized Demand**. Due to a significant boost in productivity, products that once only served mass markets can now cater to personalized needs. For example, AI can help users customize personal websites, applications, etc. This demand is vast, diverse, and far exceeds the scope of traditional front-end development. Demand serving niche markets or small groups will increase substantially.
2.  **The Trend Towards Decentralization**. Data sovereignty returns to the user. This is a crucial shift from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. Users want control over their data and expect applications to respect and protect their data privacy. This will inevitably give rise to new product forms, reconstructing all existing applications. This trend is already prevalent in the blockchain world and is emerging in collaborative document tools. Currently, the decentralized world still lacks a critical component: the traffic distribution system of the traditional internet. Traffic in the decentralized world remains isolated islands. Whoever connects these islands will fulfill the function of traditional internet traffic distribution, dealing a fatal blow to traditional internet giants. From advertisers (Google) and social networks (Facebook, X) to content platforms (YouTube, TikTok) and e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Taobao), all are beneficiaries of traffic distribution. A traffic distribution system[^1] for the decentralized world will represent a massive market demand. Moreover, decentralization implies borderlessness and a global market impervious to political severance, which is far larger than any single national market.
3.  **The Trend of 'Everything Programmable'**. The virtual digital world (cloud, social networks, media, finance, etc.) will undoubtedly become increasingly open. Traditional physical devices (IoT), furniture, cars, industry, cities, etc., will all become digitized, intelligent, and programmable. Future front-end development will extend beyond web and mobile apps to various physical devices and environments. Users will want visual interfaces to control and manage these devices. Additionally, new fields like bio-programming, VR/AR/MR, and brain-computer interfaces will require new development technologies and tools for user interaction and experience.

## The Future Belongs to the Age of Taste

**For individuals, enhancing personal taste and influence will be the most important thing in the future world.**

People cannot fully agree with or understand each other. Respecting individual differences is a fundamental, overarching judgment. However, people are not entirely unique or different from one another. In many dimensions, humans are similar. Taste is precisely the crucial method humans use to identify their peers. Taste is a complex cognitive structure encompassing understanding and perception of aesthetics, culture, values, and more. A person's taste often reflects their inner cultivation and aesthetic sensibility.

One cannot pretend to be someone else, as they are easily seen through by others. One can only become a better, purer version of oneself, representing their own kind to voice opinions or create products to serve that group. If AI's productivity greatly increases and barriers to entry plummet in the future, you can expect everyone to have the ability to use AI to create products for the masses. In that scenario, any taste masquerading as another's will pale in comparison before the genuine article, failing to gain recognition from that group. Therefore, one can only be purely oneself, refining their own taste. Only this kind of taste can earn recognition from peers and establish a foothold in the future world.

In the future, a vulgar person must be thoroughly vulgar to gain recognition from as many people as possible; an elegant person must be purely elegant to find kindred spirits. The vulgar may take a route with a large audience but low unit price, while the elegant may take a route with a small audience but high unit price. It remains to be seen which yields greater returns.

In recent years, internet products have converged in development, driven by the benefits of traffic distribution leading to product homogenization. In the future, with the emergence of decentralized traffic distribution systems, product development will return to being taste-driven. Different groups with varying tastes will have different product forms catering to their unique needs.

Take me, for example. As someone who pursues efficient, concise, and elegant product forms, I prefer minimalist applications focusing on user experience and functionality. Others might favor华丽, complex, diverse product forms emphasizing visual effects and entertainment. Future products will be more diverse, meeting the needs of groups with different tastes.

# The Capital Long Game: Reiteration and Discussion of Philosophy

2026-01-30

## Meeting Context

During the business seminar and follow-up work planning meeting on January 29, 2026, the team conducted an in-depth review of the recent losses from the Midas strategy, and I once again clarified the core investment philosophy of the "Capital Long Game." This article organizes and supplements the meeting content, aiming to help readers better understand this investment framework.

## Midas Loss Post-Mortem

### Loss Overview

- Around January 28, the Midas strategy experienced a significant drawdown (4%) in trading the HYPE token.
- In contrast, the PolyMarket strategy performed relatively stably.

### Analysis of Loss Causes

1.  **Issues with Market Asset Characteristics**
    *   The HYPE token has a very small market cap, with historical data spanning just over a year.
    *   There are clear signs of market manipulation (e.g., a 50% single-day surge).
    *   The "mean reversion" force that regression-type strategies rely on fails for such small-cap tokens.

2.  **Strategy Limitations**
    *   Regression-type strategies have a high win rate but struggle to handle unconventional market conditions.
    *   Mechanical stop-losses cannot adapt to all market structures.
    *   Out-of-sample losses are difficult to predict through backtesting.

### Key Lessons

> "Regression-type strategies, while having a high win rate, are actually very difficult to execute well."

*   Blindly pursuing "stable profits" is a trap.
*   Higher position exposure equals greater risk.
*   A clear choice must be made between "steady returns" and "chasing large gains."
*   Significant losses still cause psychological shock for investors, even with prior mental preparation.

## Reiteration of the Capital Long Game Philosophy

### The Coordinate System of Investment Intent

Through in-depth discussion, we clarified two diametrically opposed investment intents:

| Type                     | Characteristics                                   | Investor Mindset       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Positive Cash Flow (**Power Generation**) | Has stable income expectations, pursues fixed returns. | Seeks certainty.       |
| Negative Cash Flow (**Power Consumption**) | Has stable expenditure expectations, pursues exponential growth. | Seeks high payoff ratios. |

Deconstruction is necessary first to clearly understand the essence of an investment strategy. Often, investors confuse the purposes of "power generation" and "power consumption," leading to a disconnect between strategy design and actual needs.

### The Possibility of a Combined Strategy

Is it possible to want both "stable returns" and "exponential growth"?

**Yes.** It's logical: if you have a generator and an appliance, you can certainly use part of the cash flow to pursue some degree of exponential growth. This is a question of a **combined strategy**. Self-evidently, the world contains vast numbers of both generators and appliances. The investment world is no different.

"Wanting both" is not impossible. The key is that the design of the generator and the appliance must separate the two intents. Both sides must be pushed to their extremes to create sufficient tension. Only then can the optimal efficiency balance point be found between extreme generation and extreme consumption. The key insight here is that generation does not depend on how power is consumed, and consumption does not depend on the generation method. **Electricity is homogeneous, and cash flow is also homogeneous.** The two can be designed completely independently; they can be decoupled, connected only via the cash flow interface.

Use a hoe for weeding, use an axe for chopping wood. **A strategy is a tool, investment intent is the objective. Tools and objectives must match to be effective.**

This is especially true for capital management and risk control logic, which must clearly distinguish between the two. If pursuing the exponential growth of "power consumption," one must accept its inherently "unstable" nature and accept **negative cash flow**. One cannot design risk control and capital management logic with a "power generation" mindset, and vice versa. In the investment industry, this is commonly referred to as the philosophy of "profits and losses sharing the same source." If a tool's design simultaneously pursues both intents, it will inevitably lead to inefficiency. If a strategy is responsible for both generation and consumption, it will inevitably be indecisive, lack sufficient leverage, fail to achieve exponential growth, and fail to achieve stable profits. Ultimately, it will do neither well.

Returning to the question: If I have a generator and an appliance, package them together into a new tool, can this tool both generate and consume power? **Yes**, but it is neither the best generator nor the best appliance. It is merely a compromise tool, a designed product that can be sold to clients who accept compromise. However, this violates the principle of optimal capital allocation. Why assume users can only accept compromise tools? Why not let users choose their own generator and appliance and combine them themselves? **Tool design should focus on a single objective, allowing investors to freely combine them based on their needs.**

This combination is not difficult. Previously, the market only offered generators (or tools that appeared to be generators), so people felt combined investing was hard. In the future, if specialized appliances exist, investors can easily combine generators and appliances. Combined investing will become very simple.

### Conflicts of Interest in the Fund Industry

Fund managers in the industry have their own interests tied to assets under management (AUM). This leads them to often over-pursue "stable profits" in strategy design to attract large capital inflows. The result is often mediocre fund performance, where investors fail to achieve exponential capital growth. The manager's AUM grows exponentially, but the returns for individual investors do not. This creates a conflict of interest between managers and investors; they are not aligned. As an individual investor, I distrust any fund manager. I believe my invested capital is not utilized efficiently; much of it sits idle in accounts. Simultaneously, as a fund manager myself, AUM indeed boosts my returns from every angle, even if not fully utilized. I deeply recognize the nature of this conflict. I believe only by completely removing the AUM-driven incentive for managers can the interests of investors and managers be aligned, allowing capital to achieve exponential growth. Managers must return to the essence of "making money for investors," not "making money from AUM." Managers should not care about AUM size; they might even prefer smaller AUM, as it means lower management difficulty and more stable strategies.

### Differences from Traditional Investment Philosophy

Traditional investment philosophy pursues: **Stable annualized returns, low volatility, low drawdown.**
The Capital Long Game pursues: **Exponential capital growth within clearly defined boundaries, moving from the risk control line to the victory line.**

Goal-oriented investing focuses on the **final outcome**, not fluctuations along the way. As long as exponential capital growth is achieved over the long term, the ups and downs of the process are unimportant.

For example, the goal is to invest 100,000 annually to reach 100 million. This is a 1000x target. Using traditional philosophy, you would need a stable 100% annualized return over 10 years. Traditional investment planning is linear; it demands a linear growth path. It not only demands the final result but also nails the implementation path to a linear track. This greatly limits the choice of investment strategies. Clearly, this imposes very high requirements on the underlying strategy, making it harder to achieve.

Can we take a different path? First, define the entire battlefield, from the risk control line to the victory line, with no regard for what happens in between. Redefine the objective function: **Under given investment constraints, maximize the probability of reaching the victory line within a certain time window & minimize the time to reach it.**

Academic research suggests this might be a "goal-oriented investing" / "terminal wealth constraint" problem. I haven't delved into it personally.

### Investment Framework

#### 1. Clear Risk Boundaries

*   Define a red "Risk Control Line."
*   Investors can clearly expect: "Within this line, this is the maximum I can lose."
*   Eliminates the psychological burden of "not knowing when a crash might happen."

#### 2. Continuous Cash Inflow

*   Allow capital to be invested continuously at a fixed rate (even down to the second).
*   Even if a blow-up occurs, losses are limited to the capital already invested.
*   Solves the fear of "losing everything in a single investment."

#### 3. Dynamic Position Management

*   When profitable: Increase investment (let profits run).
*   When losing: Decrease investment (cut losses).
*   The key is using linear capital investment to chase exponential return growth.

#### 4. Redefining Victory Conditions

Traditional backtesting focuses on: **Annualized Return, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown.**

The Capital Long Game focuses on:

*   Can this strategy consistently multiply capital by N times within a certain period?
*   How many consecutive wins are needed to go from 10,000 to 10 million?
*   What is the worst-case time required?

### Theoretical Support

```
Investment: Linear growth (invest N dollars daily)
Returns: Exponential growth (double on winning streaks)
Result: Exponential will inevitably outpace linear; the target will be reached in the long run.
```

Prerequisite: The underlying strategy must possess the ability to "make substantial profits when correct."

## Core Promises Friendly to Investors

In traditional investment models, investors face three core pain points:

*   **Not knowing the maximum possible loss** — No peace of mind.
*   **Not knowing when they might win** — An endless wait.
*   **Needing to repeatedly confirm operations** — Drains energy.

The Capital Long Game fundamentally solves these through three points:

### 1. Establishing a Baseline Expectation for Losses

*   Before entering, investors know: "I can lose at most X dollars per day."
*   This red line is physical, quantifiable, not a vague "risk is controllable."
*   Investors can precisely plan their investment based on their risk tolerance.
*   The manager's responsibility is: **Never let losses exceed this line**, even establishing a risk reserve fund to cover any excess personally.

### 2. Establishing a Time Expectation for Victory

*   Investors know: "My strategy averages Y months to achieve a 100x return, after which it automatically stops."
*   There are clear victory conditions, not "not knowing when I might get rich."
*   Can plan financial goals and life rhythm accordingly.

### 3. Cash Flow Authorization Without Constant Disturbance

*   Authorize continuous cash flow once (e.g., automatically invest 1 dollar per minute).
*   No need for daily market watching, repeated confirmations, or frequent operations.
*   Investors can focus on their lives while the strategy executes automatically.

### The Correct Approach

*   First, test the strategy boundaries with small capital.
*   After confirming the strategy's effectiveness in a specific market, gradually increase investment.
*   Always maintain a state of "having a way out" — this is the prerequisite for aggressive operations.

## Answers to Common Questions

During the meeting discussion, colleagues raised several key questions, which are also areas where readers are most likely to be confused. Clarifications are provided here:

### Q1: If the market takes off during the saving phase, wouldn't that be a huge loss?

**Clarification:** This concern is valid but overlooks a key premise — **the meaning of continuous cash flow is to keep you "always in the game."**

*   The premise of the Capital Long Game is: The underlying strategy will give clear signals at the "right time."
*   Continuous cash flow injection ensures: When that "right time" arrives, you are present.
*   If you go all-in once and lose everything, you completely lose the qualification to capture the next opportunity.
*   The size of the initial principal is not important; what matters is that you "always have the opportunity to participate."

**The key is:** We are not "waiting" for takeoff; we are "ensuring we are present when takeoff happens."

### Q2: If you lose for the first 10 days, on the 11th day you can only invest 1 day's amount. What's the point?

**Clarification:** This understanding ignores the **compounding effect during profitable periods.**

*   Yes, on the 11th day, you only invest 1 day's amount.
*   But if that trade on the 11th day is profitable (e.g., doubles), your capital becomes 2 days' amount.
*   On the 12th day, you invest 2 days' amount. If profitable again, it becomes 4 days' amount.
*   **Exponential growth doesn't come from "investing a large sum once" but from "the natural expansion of capital after profits."**

This is separate from "losing for the first 10 days" — losses don't make your previous investments "go to zero"; they bring you closer to the risk control line. The key is: **You always retain the qualification to continue participating.**

### Q3: After risk is averaged out, returns are also averaged. What's the essential difference?

**Clarification:** **The core difference lies in the "leverage effect during winning streaks."**

Assume two scenarios:

*   **All-in once:** 50% win rate, win = +100%, lose = -100%.
*   **Divide into 100 equal bets:** 1% each time, win = +1%, lose = -1%.

Superficially, the mathematical expectation seems the same, but it ignores a fact:

**The Capital Long Game is not "equal betting" but "dynamic betting"** — increase investment when profitable, revert to initial investment when losing, using linear investment to chase exponential growth.

*   If you have a 10-win streak within those 100 bets:
    *   All-in: Either strike it rich or go to zero.
    *   Dynamic betting: Investment increases after each win. The returns after a 10-win streak far exceed simple linear addition; it's linear investment chasing exponential growth.

**Key point:** We are not pursuing "earning a little each time" but "using larger positions at the right moments." And we don't know when the right moment is; we can only ensure our presence through continuous investment.

### Q4: How is exponential growth measured? Can a strategy achieve it?

**Clarification:** This is a good question. **Not all strategies have the potential for exponential growth.**

Strategies with exponential growth potential:

*   High-leverage strategies (100x leverage capturing a 1% move = doubling).
*   High-volatility market strategies (MEME, Poly Market can multiply several times in a single day).

Strategies that struggle to achieve exponential growth:

*   Arbitrage strategies (continuously capturing spreads in capital flows).
*   Regression-type strategies in low-volatility markets.
*   Strategies with extremely high win rates but extremely low payoff ratios.

**Evaluation method:**

*   Ask yourself: What is the maximum multiple this strategy can achieve in its "best case"?
*   Ask yourself: How often does such an opportunity occur "on average"?
*   Ask yourself: If I miss N opportunities in a row, can my cash flow sustain it?

### Q5: Isn't this just the Martingale strategy?

**Clarification:** **No, this is the "Reverse Martingale" or "Anti-Martingale" strategy.**

| Characteristic | Martingale Strategy       | Capital Long Game (Anti-Martingale) |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Action after loss | Double down on position.  | Revert to initial position size.    |
| Action after win | Revert to initial position. | Double down on position.            |
| Risk           | Blow-up under extreme conditions. | Has a clear risk control line.      |
| Goal           | Recover losses.           | Pursue exponential growth.          |

**The Martingale strategy is "investing more when losing"; the Capital Long Game is "investing more when winning."** Their logic is completely opposite.

### Q6: What's the difference from Fixed-Fractional Investing?

**Clarification:** Fixed-Fractional Investing is "investing a percentage of the current capital," while the Capital Long Game is "investing a fixed amount based on the initial capital, dynamically adjusting investment size when profitable." When losing, the Capital Long Game's investment doesn't decrease as capital shrinks because it only considers cash flow input, with no concept of a "principal" per se. When profitable, the Capital Long Game increases investment to chase exponential growth, behaving more aggressively than Fixed-Fractional Investing. Fixed-Fractional Investing doesn't actually have a strong guarantee of risk control; its risk might be losing down to a point where the minimum investment unit can't be met. "Never going bankrupt" is its illusion.

| Characteristic | Fixed-Fractional Investing       | Capital Long Game   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Action after loss | Reduce position size.            | Revert to initial position size. |
| Action after win | Increase position size.          | Double down on position. |
| Risk           | Losses may prevent minimum investment. | Has a clear risk control line. |
| Goal           | Pursue steady growth.            | Pursue exponential growth. |

### Q7: Is the risk of exponential growth high? What if the risk control line can't be held?

**Clarification:** The risk control line is a hard wall, not a soft constraint. The manager must ensure it is never breached under any circumstances. If breached, the manager must cover the excess loss.

To prevent breaching, some form of "speed bump" must be designed. High speed means large profits, but during rapid market reversals, mechanisms must be in place to force rapid position reduction, ensuring the line isn't breached. In extreme cases, exchange liquidation and zero-liability guarantee mechanisms might be used. However, such designs might sacrifice some profit potential, requiring further experimental evaluation; this is still under exploration.

On the other hand, looking at the operational methods of large industry funds, the way to place a 10,000 yuan order is completely different from placing a 100 million yuan order. However, operating 10,000 yuan with the methodology for 100 million yuan doesn't seem problematic. This is more a matter of execution capability, which has varying levels of proficiency and can be solved through technical means.

Ultimately, the manager can establish a risk reserve fund or use insurance mechanisms to cover potential excess losses, further boosting investor confidence. The cost of the risk reserve fund can be amortized across all investors as part of the management fee. It's reasonable for investors to pay a management fee for this insurance.

### Q8: Is the Anti-Martingale strategy the source of the system's edge?

**Clarification:** **No.** The Anti-Martingale strategy itself is not the source of the system's edge. The edge comes from the underlying strategy's own profitability and market adaptability. The Anti-Martingale strategy is merely a capital management and risk control framework that helps investors better utilize the advantages of the underlying strategy. For investors, *how to reach the goal* is important, but *exactly how* it's reached is not. Traditional evaluation systems prefer strategies to reach the goal linearly and strongly dislike drawdowns, while the Capital Long Game hopes strategies reach the goal in a completely exponential manner and does not dislike drawdowns.

The Capital Long Game proposes a new investment objective: how to achieve a high absolute return value under linear investment. The Capital Long Game does not assume the Anti-Martingale strategy must be used. Rather, this strategy is well-suited to achieving the Capital Long Game's objective. If the underlying strategy itself possesses a high edge, then even using other capital management strategies might achieve the Capital Long Game's objective.

Within the context of the Capital Long Game, this new evaluation framework helps filter out strategies that truly have exponential growth potential, thereby helping investors achieve their financial goals.

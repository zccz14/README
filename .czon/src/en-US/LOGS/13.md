"title": "DeepSeek Engram Paper Analysis: A New Memory Mechanism for Large Language Models"
"summary": "This article analyzes the Engram paper released by DeepSeek on January 13, 2026. The paper proposes a novel memory mechanism that allows large language models to dynamically query and utilize externally stored memory fragments during text generation. Implemented via a scalable lookup table, this approach not only enhances the model's contextual understanding and generation capabilities but also significantly reduces computational resource consumption, enabling efficient operation even in resource-constrained environments. The paper also explores the impact of the Engram-to-MoE component ratio on performance, finding a U-shaped curve that emphasizes the importance of balancing different components. From a philosophical perspective, the article likens this advancement to innovations like the Attention mechanism and MoE, viewing it as part of an ongoing exploration of efficient operation in complex systems. Overall, Engram provides a new direction for memory mechanisms in large language models, promising to drive the development of more intelligent and efficient models."

Tuesday, January 13, 2026, morning.

Another early start today, waking up a little after 7 AM. Upon waking, I discovered DeepSeek has released a new paper proposing a new technique called Engram.

[DeepSeek - Engram Open Source Repository](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Engram), which includes a Demo and the paper PDF.

The paper is titled *Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models.*

The core idea of the paper is the introduction of a new memory mechanism that allows the model to dynamically query and utilize externally stored memory fragments during text generation, thereby enhancing the model's contextual understanding and generation capabilities.

This mechanism is implemented via a scalable lookup table, allowing the model to access relevant memory content when needed, rather than relying solely on the model's internal parameters. This method not only improves model performance but also significantly reduces computational resource consumption, enabling large-scale language models to operate efficiently even in resource-constrained environments.

The introduction of this memory mechanism opens up new directions for the development of large language models, particularly in handling long texts and complex tasks, where it can better leverage external knowledge and contextual information.

Furthermore, the paper compares the optimization problem regarding the component ratio of Engram versus MoE, finding that the Engram/MoE ratio's impact on performance follows a U-shaped curve. This indicates that when designing large models, carefully balancing the proportions of different components is a crucial consideration.

Philosophically speaking, from "Attention is All You Need," to "Mixture of Experts," and now to Engram, this represents a continuous exploration of how to more efficiently utilize model parameters and computational resources to enhance model expressiveness and generalization capabilities. From stem cells to differentiated cells, and then to organ systems, each step is an exploration of how complex systems operate efficiently. We may see more innovations like this in the future, driving large language models towards greater intelligence and efficiency.

Overall, this paper provides a new perspective on memory mechanisms for large language models and is worthy of further research and exploration.

It's worth noting: what surprises will the upcoming DeepSeek v4 bring?

Looking forward to it...

"title": "Claude Opus Relay Service Cost Analysis"
"summary": "This article documents the author's experience on February 2, 2026, resolving a Claude Opus model quota exhaustion issue by using a relay service, discovering costs far lower than official pricing. It provides a detailed comparison between Anthropic's official pricing and that of a relay service provider (calculated per 1M Tokens). Official input cost is 35 CNY, output is 175 CNY, while the relay service charges 0.189 CNY and 0.947 CNY respectively—a gap of approximately 185 times. The author infers Anthropic's actual costs are even lower, with a potential gross margin exceeding 99.46%, far surpassing competitors like DeepSeek. The article notes that while relay services pose privacy risks, they are a cost-effective choice for non-sensitive tasks (e.g., open-source projects, learning/research), and expresses astonishment at the pricing frenzy in the AI industry."

It is now Monday, February 2, 2026, early morning.

I've resolved the issue of my Claude Opus model quota running out. I found a relay service, and the cost is even lower than DeepSeek. I've realized just how terrifying the gross margins of AI companies can be.

According to Anthropic's [official pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/zh-CN/about-claude/pricing), calculated per 1M Tokens:

| Model           | Base Input Tokens | 5m Cache Writes | 1h Cache Writes | Cache Hits & Refreshes | Output Tokens |
| --------------- | :---------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :--------------------: | :-----------: |
| Claude Opus 4.5 |        $5         |      $6.25      |       $10       |         $0.50          |      $25      |

In contrast, the relay service provider quotes: Input 0.1890 CNY, Output 0.9470 CNY, also per 1M Tokens.

Using an exchange rate of 1 USD = 7.0 CNY, the official INPUT cost is 35 CNY, while the relay service's INPUT cost is 0.189 CNY—a difference of **185.2 times**. The official OUTPUT cost is 175 CNY, while the relay service's OUTPUT cost is 0.947 CNY—a difference of **184.8 times**. In summary, Anthropic's official pricing is roughly **185 times** that of the relay service provider.

And obviously, Anthropic's real costs must be even lower than the relay service provider's. Even using the relay service's price as a benchmark, Anthropic's gross margin is as high as 99.46%. The relay service provider certainly needs to make some profit, meaning Anthropic's gross margin is even higher. Furthermore, Anthropic surely doesn't supply the relay service at cost price. It's a frightening thought.

I used to think AI in this world was expensive. Even the "People's AI" (DeepSeek, the king of cost-performance) sells at 2 CNY INPUT + 3 CNY OUTPUT. But a relay service provider can push the cost of a SOTA model (Claude Opus) to less than 1/3 of DeepSeek's price. This world is just too crazy.

Alright, overall, relay servers still carry significant privacy risks. However, for many non-sensitive tasks (like working on open-source projects, learning, research, etc.), using a relay server remains a good choice. After all, the cost difference is simply too vast.

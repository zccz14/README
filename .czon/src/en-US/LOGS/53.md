It is Sunday morning, February 8, 2026.

Over the weekend, C1 went skiing again, and Mage returned home after the holiday, ready to kick off a new project: **Prediction Market Arbitrage**.

Arbitrage opportunities in prediction markets are relatively scattered, but the arbitrage hedging structure is very clear. This means any arbitrageur will decisively execute arbitrage, quickly eliminating the arbitrage opportunities. Therefore, prediction market arbitrage places very high demands on execution efficiency.

Thus, this is a **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** project. From a technology selection perspective, it requires using the Rust language to implement a low-latency trading execution system. We'll need to write it in Rust. Given our team's current tech stack, it seems we'll have to start with vibe coding for now. Fortunately, Rust's compiler is robust and can help us communicate issues with AI.

This is a good opportunity to familiarize ourselves with Rust's ecosystem and toolchain, preparing for the future. I had some exposure to Rust when working on Solana smart contracts before, but I didn't dive too deep into it.

Looking forward to the challenges ahead!

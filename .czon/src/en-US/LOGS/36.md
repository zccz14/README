"summary": "This article documents the author's experience using the OpenClaw AI tool on January 31, 2026, including the process of deploying it on an Alibaba Cloud ECS server and connecting it to a Feishu bot. The author notes that OpenClaw is more suitable for local deployment, as cloud servers are costly and its functionality is limited without installing various tools. The article compares the performance of the MiniMax M2.1 and Opus models, concluding that Opus is significantly superior for programming tasks. The author used OpenCode + Opus to complete the code for the Capital Protracted War experiment, which is open-sourced on GitHub. Preliminary experimental results are shared: under a high-volatility GBM market model, a basic mean reversion strategy combined with anti-Martingale money management can achieve exponential capital growth even with transaction costs, whereas a trend-following strategy cannot. This highlights the advantage of high-win-rate strategies. The author states that further validation is needed and invites readers to follow the open-source project."

It's the evening of 2026-01-31.

I've been heavily experimenting with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) recently, a very popular AI tool. It can control an entire machine with full permissions. I deployed it on an Alibaba Cloud ECS server equipped with the MiniMax M2.1 model and connected it to my Feishu bot. Now I can communicate with OpenClaw through Feishu, and OpenClaw will help me execute various tasks.

However, OpenClaw is currently more suitable for installation on a local, clean machine. It's not particularly well-suited for cloud servers, mainly because cloud servers are expensive. Without installing various tools, such as a browser, OpenClaw's functionality is quite limited. This also proves, to some extent, that the world's APIs are not yet very "open," often requiring browsers or various apps to complete tasks.

Another issue is that OpenClaw equipped with MiniMax M2.1 still seems not very intelligent. Although the author mentioned that Peter Steinberger said MiniMax M2.1 is the best open-source model, he also noted that Opus is far ahead. In my view, MiniMax M2.1 is still relatively weak. I wonder how effective OpenClaw + Opus would be.

My GitHub Copilot subscription allows limited access to the Opus model, but I cannot use it with OpenClaw—only within OpenCode. My quota resets tomorrow, February 1st, so I decided to use up my quota today.

Thus, I had OpenCode + Opus help me write the experimental code for the Capital Protracted War, [open-sourced here](https://github.com/zccz14/CapitalProtractedWar). I must say, I tried this once before with MiniMax M2.1, and the result was terrible. Opus performed significantly better, truly deserving its status as the SOTA model for coding.

The experimental report will be maintained in the open-source project. However, I can share the current experimental conclusions:

**Under a high-volatility GBM market model, a basic mean reversion strategy combined with anti-Martingale money management can achieve exponential capital growth even with transaction costs.**

Surprisingly, a trend-following strategy under anti-Martingale money management cannot achieve exponential growth, whereas the mean reversion strategy can. This highlights the advantage of high-win-rate strategies. However, I remain skeptical and need further validation. My intuition tells me that even with a lower win rate, a trend-following strategy should also be capable of exponential growth.

Further validation is still needed. Please follow the open-source project for the Capital Protracted War experiment!

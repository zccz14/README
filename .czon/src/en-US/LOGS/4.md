Today is January 8, 2026, evening.

I slept in the morning and got up in the evening to chat with Thrimbda about the future direction of ZEN. Here are some thoughts I recorded.

He suggested considering turning ZEN into a publishable knowledge base and mentioned that if it could support custom frontends, he would migrate his blog over.
Specifically, his requirements can be broken down into supporting custom themes, permanent links, document lists, and carousel images.

I think after implementing these features, it would indeed be a good time to release ZEN 1.0.0. Perhaps I should draft a release plan.

However, I noticed that the name ZEN is already overused. There are several projects named ZEN on GitHub, so maybe I should consider changing the name. I want a relatively short name that is at least not taken on npm, since it will eventually be launched using an npx command, and the CLI name shouldn't be too long. I plan to host it under a subdomain of my personal domain. It doesn’t need an independent second-level domain since I don’t intend to commercialize it.

After searching through a bunch of names, I finally think CZone `czon` is pretty good. It stands for cz + zone (cz zone, content zone), representing a content area, a knowledge area. `czon` is not taken on npm. By the way, when I tried to register `czone`, npm said it was too similar to `clone` and wouldn’t allow it. But `czon` is also good, and it’s even shorter.

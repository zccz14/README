"title": "Work Log: Reflections and Planning on the Pyramiding Strategy"
"summary": "This is a work log documenting the author's work and thoughts on January 17, 2026. The author's efficiency was reduced due to a cold, but they continued to delve into the pyramiding strategy, considering it an effective capital management method that leverages volatility clustering for rapid capital growth. Inspired by 'On Protracted War' and stories of futures trading veterans, the author plans to systematize the strategy and supports its potential with real-world examples (such as an experience shared on X platform of growing from $12 to $100,000). Additionally, the author reflects on the purpose of keeping a log, viewing it not just as a record but also as material for AI training and future planning, and expresses gratitude to the team for their support, which allows focused thinking."

2026-01-17, Afternoon.

I actually went to bed before midnight last night because I was too tired. Woke up very late this morning with a terrible headache—probably caught a cold.
Quickly made a meal and took some medicine. Today's work efficiency is likely not going to be high. Re-read 'On Protracted War' yesterday because I was planning an article on 'Pyramiding is the Only Way for Capital Management,' hoping to find historical examples to support the argument and learn from the wisdom of great figures. Also revisited C1's blog and realized that while I once said, 'Who keeps a diary seriously?', I now find myself writing something similar, which is quite interesting. But back then, I was just referencing a meme—a line from the movie 'Hidden Man.'

Honestly, what I write isn't exactly a diary; it's more of a work log, recording daily tasks and reflections. While some content is trivial, other parts involve planning and thinking about future projects and directions. On another note, this is also preparation for AI training. After all, future AI assistants will need to understand my work habits and thought processes to better assist me with tasks. Furthermore, by the end of 2026, I'll have accumulated enough content. I wonder what my year-end summary will look like then.

Thanks to delegating work to my team, otherwise, I'd probably be busy day and night with no time to write these things. I hope to have more time and energy in the future to think about and plan larger projects and directions, rather than being tied down by trivial tasks. Grateful for the support and help from my team, allowing me to focus on thinking and planning.

Regarding recent work, the 'pyramiding' strategy actually sprouted years ago when I heard stories about futures trading veterans. While others marveled at their ability to pick assets and time the market, I started contemplating the potential of 'pyramiding' as a capital management strategy. When I asked [on the 16th](./15.md) how to make 20 million in a year, the approach for the 'pyramiding' strategy had already taken shape in my mind. Next, I need to systematize this strategy into a complete capital management framework and validate its effectiveness through practical application.

This morning, Brother Ji sent a message saying someone on X shared their experience of turning $12 into $100,000, primarily using an all-in pyramiding strategy, achieving this through 16 consecutive wins. It seems this strategy indeed has its unique appeal and potential, worthy of in-depth study and application. In pure gambling games, luck likely plays a major role. However, in market trading, favorable and unfavorable conditions often cluster (aka volatility clustering). If one can seize opportunities during favorable clustering and utilize the pyramiding strategy, it is indeed possible to achieve rapid capital growth.

January 17, 2026, afternoon.

Last night, I actually went to bed before midnight because I was too tired. I woke up very late this morning and found that I had a terrible headache—probably caught a cold.  
I quickly made a meal and took some medicine. It seems my work efficiency won’t be too high today. Yesterday, I reread *On Protracted War* because I was planning an article about "Adding to Winning Positions is the Only Way for Capital Management." I wanted to find some historical examples to support my point and learn from the wisdom of great figures. I also revisited C1’s blog and realized that while I once said, "Who keeps a diary seriously?" I now find myself writing something similar to a diary, which is quite interesting. But back then, I was just referencing a meme—a line from the movie *Hidden Man*.

To be honest, what I write isn’t exactly a diary; it’s more like a work log, recording daily tasks and reflections. Although some content is trivial, there are also thoughts and plans for future projects and directions. On the other hand, this is also preparation for AI training. After all, future AI assistants will need to understand my work habits and thought processes to better assist me with tasks. Moreover, by the end of 2026, I’ll have accumulated enough content. I wonder what my 2026 year-end summary will look like then.

Thanks to delegating work to my teammates, I’m not constantly busy day and night and actually have time to write these things. I hope to have more time and energy in the future to think about and plan larger projects and directions, rather than being tied down by trivial tasks. I’m grateful for my teammates’ support and help, which allows me to focus on thinking and planning.

Speaking of recent work, the "Adding to Winning Positions" strategy actually sprouted years ago when I heard stories about futures trading veterans. While others marveled at their ability to pick assets and time the market, I was already contemplating the potential of this capital management strategy. When I asked [on the 16th](./15.md) how to earn 20 million in a year, the approach of the "Adding to Winning Positions" strategy had already taken shape in my mind. Next, I need to systematize this strategy into a complete capital management framework and validate its effectiveness through practical application.

This morning, Brother Ji sent a message saying that someone on X shared their experience of turning $12 into $100,000, mainly relying on the "All-in on Winning Positions" strategy, achieving this by winning 16 consecutive trades. It seems this strategy indeed has its unique charm and potential, worthy of in-depth research and application. In pure gambling games, luck likely plays a bigger role. However, in market trading, favorable and unfavorable conditions often cluster (aka. volatility clustering). If one can seize opportunities during favorable clustering and leverage the "Adding to Winning Positions" strategy, it’s indeed possible to achieve rapid capital growth.

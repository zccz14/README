# Trickle Fund

It's the evening of February 13, 2026.

After finishing the [Guiding Principles for Fund Design](./65.md) yesterday, I've been pondering a question: What should this fund be called?

"Protracted War Fund" was my first thought, but it never felt quite right. It's too militaristic; as the name of a financial product, it sounds a bit odd. Furthermore, the phrase "protracted war" easily conjures images of a long, draining conflict, which isn't entirely consistent with the message we want to convey.

Finally, I thought of **Trickle**.

The beauty of the word "trickle" lies in its intersection of water and electricity. On the water side, a trickling stream is small, continuous, and precisely describes the pattern of investor-authorized cash flow. On the electricity side, "trickle charging" is a term in electrical engineering, referring to charging a battery with a very small, constant current over time.

Recall the power generation/consumption framework we proposed [earlier](./35.md): An investor authorizing a constant cash flow rate (e.g., 1 USD/day) is essentially performing trickle charging for the "appliance." When the fund takes profits and distributes cash flow to investors, it's generating power. The pre-funded balance transferred to EA to earn current account interest is also a form of energy storage. The entire system is a cycle of trickle charging and discharging.

Therefore, the fund is officially named **涓流基金 (Trickle Fund)**, with the English name **Trickle Fund**.

The word "trickle" works well in English too. "Trickle down" refers to the trickle-down effect, "trickle charge" is trickle charging, and "trickle" itself means "to flow in a thin, gentle stream." It's concise, memorable, and requires no extra explanation. Those who understand can appreciate the water-electricity double meaning, while those unfamiliar can intuitively grasp the concept of "small and continuous."

A good name should be like this: it doesn't require explanation, but it can withstand explanation.

It is now February 6, 2026.

Continuing the dialogue with AI to explore the concept of "taste." This is a further development of the ideas in INSIGHTS/8 regarding "taste as direction."

## Defining Taste: Choice is a Prerequisite for Taste

In the conversation, I proposed: **Taste is only evident when faced with choices. A person on the verge of starvation, grabbing any food available, cannot demonstrate their taste in food. Taste requires choice; without choice, taste cannot be expressed.**

AI expanded on this direction, proposing a three-layer structure for taste:

### 1. The Prerequisite for Taste: Margin

Taste is a luxury of choice. Margin is not just material:
- **Time Margin**: When rushing to meet a deadline, it's about "whatever works," not "this is what I want."
- **Cognitive Margin**: When overloaded with information, it's about "save for later," not "this isn't worth reading."
- **Emotional Margin**: When driven by fear or greed, it's about reaction, not choice.

This reminds me of the emphasis on "cash flow input" in INSIGHTS/6, *The Capital Endurance War*—controlling the rate of loss is essentially about **creating margin**. With margin, one can discuss taste; without it, it's just survival.

### 2. The Essence of Taste: The Ability to Reject

AI offered an interesting perspective: Taste is not about "what I like," but about "what I am willing to give up."

In INSIGHTS, I often record what I reject in the form of "counterarguments." For example, in *The Capital Endurance War*:
- I rejected the dogma of "steady but slow."
- I rejected the opportunism of "get rich quick but lose control."
- I rejected the cynicism of "destined to fail."

**Choice is the surface of taste; rejection is its skeleton.** This statement is precise.

### 3. The Source of Taste: Experience + Reflection + Stance

Taste is not an innate quality but a **stance formed through the reflection of experience**.
- **Experience**: Having stumbled and fallen.
- **Reflection**: Transforming experience into principles.
- **Stance**: Choosing to stand on one side.

This aligns perfectly with the LOGS→INSIGHTS system: LOGS record experiences, INSIGHTS distill reflections, and "stance" is the externalization of taste.

## The Cycle of Taste and Understanding

The conversation concluded by touching on the relationship between taste and understanding:
- The pursuit of understanding is a "matter of taste"—I choose to direct cognitive resources toward "understanding."
- Taste itself is also a product of understanding—my understanding of the world shapes my standards for rejection.

The two generate each other in a cycle, mutually causal. This reaffirms my core view: **We are not fixed entities but processes continuously generated in the spiral of taste and understanding.**

## An Unexplored Question

When evaluating the previous AI's work, AI suggested several supplementary directions. I did not respond to the point about "the absence of embodiment":

> The article defines the soul as "the sum of reasoning ability and memory," but where do emotions, intuition, and bodily experience fit? These are dimensions difficult for AI to replicate, yet they are not incorporated into the framework.

This is indeed a gap. Emotions, intuition, bodily experience—how do these fit into the framework of "replicating the soul"? Can they be recorded? Can they be reflected upon? Or are they inherently ineffable, only indirectly inferred through behavior and choices?

This remains for future exploration.

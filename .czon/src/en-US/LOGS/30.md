"title": "Against Embedded TOCs and Syntax Tax, Focus on Content Creation"
"summary": "This article criticizes the practice of embedding TOCs and YAML FrontMatter in Markdown source files, arguing that these forms of 'syntax tax' distract from writing, reducing efficiency and quality. The author advocates for separating content from metadata, with tools automatically extracting and processing the latter to minimize syntax tax. The article also discusses layout optimizations possible on desktop, such as multi-column layouts and sidenotes, and suggests supporting inline comments to enhance interactivity, though this requires solving the issue of comment misplacement when the source text changes."

## Focus on Content, Minimize Distractions While Writing

After reading C1's blog, I noticed he uses embedded TOCs to generate a table of contents.

I believe this imposes an unnecessary burden on the Markdown source file.

As shown in the image below, he writes nearly 40 lines of structure and metadata before getting to the actual content.

The problem is that the TOC source code is written directly into the source file. Even though maintenance is presumably handled by specialized tools, this fills the source file with a lot of 'syntax tax' unrelated to the content itself.
In fact, writing metadata in YAML FrontMatter is also a form of syntax tax, which I firmly oppose. However, YAML FrontMatter isn't as visually intrusive as a TOC, so I haven't opposed it as vehemently until now.

I firmly believe that once you start focusing heavily on styling, formatting, structure, and layout while writing, your attention shifts away from the content itself. This distraction affects writing efficiency, quality, and ultimately, content creation.

When writing, a person's eyes constantly review previously written content. If that content is filled with various formatting syntax, attention is fragmented, making it difficult to focus on the substance.

In CZON, content metadata should be extracted, not embedded within the content itself. Content creators should not be forced to write this metadata. Content creation can be fragmented, with AI and infrastructure handling integration and layout. Reducing the syntax tax of writing is one of CZON's key objectives.

## Mobile-First, But Desktop Can Offer More Optimization

Mobile is limited to a single-column scrolling layout, while desktop can utilize multi-column layouts.
Therefore, the reading experience on desktop can be significantly enhanced.
For example, navigation bars, table of contents, etc., can be placed in sidebars, making full use of the desktop's wider screen.
For desktop, footnotes could even be converted into sidenotes, similar to some large-format printed books.

For long articles, anchor links are also essential. Since CZON 0.6.3, automatic TOC extraction and anchor functionality for headings have been supported.

## More Interesting Possibilities

For example, **supporting inline comment functionality**. This would allow readers/AI to add comments and discussions at any point in the article. This could greatly enhance the interactivity and engagement of the content. Platforms like WeChat Reading and WeChat Official Accounts support this kind of underline-and-comment interaction. The drawback is that if the original text changes, comment positions might become misaligned, requiring a more stable method of anchoring them.

It is now February 4, 2026, noon.

I went out and worked at a coffee shop.

I officially named the experimental framework for the Capital Long Game "Sand Table" and published it on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sandt) under the package name `sandt`. From now on, this project can be referred to as SandT, or simply ST.

I really like this name. Sand Table reminds me of sand table simulations in war games. The experimental framework for the Capital Long Game is precisely about simulating and deducing various capital operations and strategic decisions on a sand table. From small samples to various markets, simulations and experiments can be conducted at all levels, ultimately generating clear and intuitive reports to help us make better decisions.

The package name could have been `sand-table`, but that's too long—typing extra characters for a command-line tool is cumbersome. Additionally, "dt" can also be interpreted as an abbreviation for "delta time," representing the change in time. In short, it's a well-balanced name. Or you could think of it as S & T, standing for Strategy & Tactics. We can find many interesting interpretations on an artistic level, but these aren't the main point. What matters is that it's memorable and concise.

I hope it can play an important role and avoid falling into the trap of being mere armchair theorizing.

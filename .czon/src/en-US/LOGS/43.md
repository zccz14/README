"title": "Sand Table Capital Persistence War Experimental Framework Released"
"summary": "This article documents the author's process of releasing the Capital Persistence War experimental framework on February 4, 2026. The framework is named Sand Table, with the package name sandt, and has been published to the npm platform. The author explains that the naming inspiration comes from sand table simulations in war games, emphasizing that the framework aims to simulate capital operations and strategic decisions, conducting experiments and generating reports from micro samples to macro market levels to aid decision-making. The author also discusses the reasons for choosing the package name, including conciseness, command-line convenience, and possible extended meanings (such as delta time or Strategy & Tactics), hoping the project will avoid being purely theoretical and serve a practical purpose."

It is now February 4, 2026, noon.

I went out to work at a coffee shop.

I have officially named the experimental framework for the Capital Persistence War as Sand Table and published it to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sandt) with the package name `sandt`. From now on, this project can be referred to as SandT or simply ST.

I really like this name. Sand Table reminds me of sand table simulations in war games. The experimental framework for the Capital Persistence War is precisely about allowing us to simulate and strategize various capital operations and strategic decisions on a sand table. From small samples to various markets, simulations and experiments can be conducted at all levels, ultimately generating clear and concise reports to help us make better decisions.

The package could have been named `sand-table`, but that's too long and would be cumbersome for a command-line tool. Additionally, "dt" can also be interpreted as an abbreviation for delta time, representing the passage of time. Overall, it's a well-balanced name. Alternatively, you could think of it as S & T, standing for Strategy & Tactics. We can find many interesting interpretations on an artistic level, but these are not the main point. What matters is that it's memorable and short.

I hope it can play a significant role and avoid falling into the trap of being purely theoretical.

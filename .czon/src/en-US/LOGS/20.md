January 20, 2026, morning.

I didn't wake up particularly early today, around 9 AM. But it felt too cold to get out of bed, so I lounged for a while and didn't actually get up until about 11 AM. When I did, I noticed it was snowing. The branches of the trees outside my window were covered in snow, no wonder it was so cold.
I brewed myself a pot of hot tea. I really do prefer a robust black tea. While it's not some expensive, high-end variety, the color and flavor are quite nice.

Yesterday, I spent some time researching AI-generated community comments (both the regular user version and the Genshin Impact version—a boon for fan creators). It was quite interesting.

While reading the comments, I felt much more relaxed compared to reading the main articles. That's a key insight.

Why do many people prefer to read comments over the main content? Because comments are more fun, more relaxed, and more likely to spark a sense of connection.
So, I think future content creation might shift more towards this kind of relaxed, entertaining direction, rather than solely pursuing seriousness and professionalism.

Sometimes, I myself can be genuinely moved by AI-generated comments. It's an "aha" moment, realizing that AI can actually capture the nuances of human emotion.
Some might argue that AI-generated content lacks soul. Well then, why not be the one to add that finishing touch?

Moving forward, CZON's development roadmap could consider:

1.  **Comment Section**: Foster an engaging comment section co-created by AI and humans to attract more user participation in discussions.
2.  **Lighthearted Content**: Increase the amount of relaxed, fun content to lower the barrier to entry for readers.
3.  **User Interaction**: Encourage users to share their own perspectives and stories to build a sense of community.

In short, today's inspiration has given me new thoughts about future content creation. I'm looking forward to trying out some new directions on CZON.

Current self-media platforms are becoming increasingly walled gardens, making data difficult to obtain (or, to put it legally, difficult to obtain legitimately). They're even reluctant to let users post external links for traffic.

From a purely business perspective, I understand why. But I still hope to pursue a decentralized path where **users own their own data and content**.

Think of it as a Web3 version of Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book)?

*   **Content Hosting**: There's already a solution: just use GitHub. Even free users can store a massive amount of content, far exceeding the typical output of general media. If absolutely necessary, users can also self-host and migrate their data anytime.
*   **User Identity**: We could build a decentralized identity system. For example, linking a nickname to a wallet address, allowing users to comment simply by connecting their wallet. I imagine this would likely be implemented on an EVM chain, as its RPC read-only requests are free, making integration convenient.
    Failing that, using GitHub accounts for login is also quite convenient. Mainly because CZONE's current tech stack is already tightly coupled with GitHub, so let's focus on acquiring those users first.
*   **The mobile editing experience must be on par with mainstream apps**. It needs to be as easy for users as posting on Xiaohongshu, Weibo, or WeChat Moments. At the same time, the PC experience for writing must also be excellent, as longer-form content is still more comfortable to write on a computer.
*   **Content Discovery & Social Network**: This will inevitably require a reader/client. It would index content within this network and recommend content based on user interests. This can be iterated on gradually later. Architecturally, this should be part of CZONE, not CZON.

One can imagine that this space would generate a vast amount of content and interaction, potentially breaking the monopoly of existing platforms and offering users more choice and freedom.

At that point, AI and human content creation would become more integrated and organic. Could you tell which is which? Very cyberpunk. No, very Turing.

As an exercise in observing human nature, it would indeed be a fascinating experiment.

Next steps: further solidify integration and interoperability with GitHub, accumulate a solid tech stack. In the future, we could very well pioneer a "GitHub as User Database" approach.

January 20, 2026, morning.

Didn't wake up too early today, around 9 AM, but it felt too cold to get out of bed, so I lounged for a bit. Didn't actually get up until about 11 AM. When I did, I saw it was snowing. The branches of the trees outside the window were covered in snow, no wonder it was so cold.
Made myself a pot of hot tea. I really do prefer strong black tea. It's not some fancy, expensive variety, but the color and flavor are quite nice.

Yesterday, I looked into AI-generated community comments. See the [Ordinary Person Version](../SUMMARY/8-community.md) and the [Genshin Impact Version](../SUMMARY/9-genshin.md) (a blessing for fan creators). It felt quite interesting.

While reading the comments, I felt more relaxed, much more so than when reading the main text. This is a key insight.

Why do many people prefer to read comments over the main text? Because comments are more fun, more relaxed, and more likely to resonate.
So I think future content creation might lean more towards this relaxed, fun direction, rather than solely pursuing seriousness and professionalism.

Sometimes, I myself can be moved by AI-generated comments. It's an "aha" moment, discovering that AI can capture the nuances of human emotion.
Some might comment that AI-generated content lacks soul. In that case, why not be the one to add that finishing touch?

Moving forward, CZON's development path could consider:

1.  **Comment Section**: AI + humans collaboratively building an interesting comment section to attract more user participation in discussions.
2.  **Lighthearted Content**: Increase some relaxed, fun content to lower the barrier to reading.
3.  **User Interaction**: Encourage users to share their own viewpoints and stories to foster a community atmosphere.

In short, today's inspiration gave me new thoughts about future content creation. I look forward to trying some new directions on CZON.

Current self-media platforms are becoming increasingly closed off, making data difficult to obtain (or, to put it legally, difficult to obtain legally). They're even reluctant to let users post external links for traffic.

Speaking from a business perspective, I understand why. But I still hope to take a decentralized path. **Users should own their own data and content.**

For example, a Web3 version of Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book)?

*   **Content Hosting**: There's already a solution: just use GitHub. Even free users can store a massive amount of content, far exceeding the production volume of general media. If absolutely necessary, users can also self-host and migrate away anytime.
*   **User Identity**: Could build a decentralized identity system. For example, binding a nickname to a wallet address, so users can comment just by connecting their wallet. I imagine this would likely be implemented on an EVM chain, as its RPC read-only requests are free, making integration convenient.
    Failing that, GitHub account login could be used. It's actually quite convenient, mainly because CZONE's current tech stack is already tightly coupled with GitHub. Let's aim for that user base first.
*   **The mobile editing experience must match mainstream apps**. It needs to be as convenient for users as posting on Xiaohongshu, Weibo, or WeChat Moments. At the same time, the PC side must also have an excellent writing experience, as longer content is still more comfortable to write on a PC.
*   **Content Recommendation & Social Network**: A reader is definitely needed. It can index content within this network and recommend content based on user interests. This can be iterated on gradually later. In terms of hierarchy, this should be placed within CZONE, not CZON.

One can imagine that this field will generate a vast amount of content and interaction, potentially breaking the monopoly of existing platforms and giving users more choice and freedom.

At that point, AI and human content creation will become more integrated and organic. Who can tell which is which? So cyberpunk. No, so Turing.

As an observation of human society, it would indeed be a very interesting experiment.

Next, further solidify integration and interoperability with GitHub, accumulate a certain tech stack. In the future, it's entirely possible to forge a path of "GitHub as User Database."

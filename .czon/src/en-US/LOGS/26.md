It is now the afternoon of January 24, 2026.

A topic not deeply discussed in the draft of [Capital Endurance War](../INSIGHTS/6.md) was **leverage**.

Leverage is an unavoidable objective reality. Moreover, leverage is ubiquitous; it does not disappear due to human subjective will and cannot be avoided.

People often think that "using leverage" is an extremely risky endeavor. In fact, it is similar to vehicle speed—not inherently dangerous, but dangerous when people cannot control it.

Not participating in the market means zero leverage. Partial participation means a leverage ratio less than 1. Going all-in without borrowing means a leverage ratio equal to 1. Participating in the market with borrowed funds means a leverage ratio greater than 1. For now, the natural domain of leverage is non-negative real numbers.

In reality, it can also be negative, such as in short selling. Thus, the domain of leverage is the entire set of real numbers.

Regardless of whether individuals believe they are using leverage, leverage is at work. People often overlook this.

Next question: **What is the relationship between leverage and volatility?**

The mathematical essence of volatility and leverage is the same.

For example, an asset with a daily volatility of 1% but usable with 10x leverage is mathematically equivalent to an asset with a daily volatility of 10% but usable with only 1x leverage. This is because the effect of leverage can be linearly transformed into the effect on price, which in turn linearly determines the effect of volatility. Readers should ponder this carefully.

The strategic space available to traders in these two assets is completely equivalent.

Therefore, by Occam's razor, leverage can be reduced to volatility.

In markets with higher volatility, the victory depicted in the Capital Endurance War is easier to achieve.

**On-Exchange Leverage vs. Off-Exchange Leverage**

- On-exchange leverage refers to trading using leverage tools provided by exchanges, such as margin trading, futures contracts, etc. It typically has no interest cost.
- Off-exchange leverage refers to leverage obtained through borrowing, financing, etc. It usually incurs interest costs, but there may be risk transfer methods to mitigate the risks of high leverage.

On-exchange leverage is generally easier to access and use but is limited by exchange rules and restrictions. Off-exchange leverage is more flexible but requires consideration of borrowing costs and risk management.

Using comprehensive leverage strategies can yield higher capital efficiency and risk-adjusted returns.

**The Leverage Nature of Funds**

In traditional markets, professional investors attempt to obtain off-exchange leverage by launching funds.

Typically, investors bear the risk of fund losses themselves, while private fund managers usually demand 20%-30% of excess performance (industry norms cap this at 60%) as a performance fee.

Taking a 20% performance fee as an example, the manager essentially obtains 20% of risk-free raised capital as leverage for free. For instance, if the manager invests 1 million themselves and the total fundraising amount is 100 million, it is equivalent to the manager investing 21 million, resulting in an off-exchange leverage ratio of 21x. If on-exchange leverage (e.g., 5x) is added, the total leverage ratio would reach an astonishing 105x. Factoring in the market's inherent volatility (e.g., 5% daily volatility), the equivalent daily volatility would be 525%, meaning the asset's daily fluctuation range would be an astounding 5.25x.

Based on the manager's own capital of 1 million, in such an ordinary market, the manager's daily profit or loss fluctuation would reach 5.25 million. This is how powerful leverage is.

Leverage-adjusted market volatility = Market volatility × On-exchange leverage ratio × Off-exchange leverage ratio

Among these, market volatility and on-exchange leverage ratio are generally beyond an individual's control, while off-exchange leverage ratio is the leverage individuals can fully grasp.

**The Cost of Off-Exchange Leverage**

Using off-exchange leverage incurs direct costs, mainly including:

- Interest cost: Borrowed funds typically require interest payments, which reduce overall returns.
- Performance cost: As mentioned, fund managers usually demand a share of excess performance, equivalent to forfeiting part of the returns.

These two dimensions of cost include interest costs that accumulate over time and performance costs that grow with returns. Interest must be paid rigidly, while performance costs can be shared with financiers to spread risk. This is why professional fund managers prefer obtaining leverage through performance fees rather than borrowing.

However, in my view, the market's inherent volatility multiplied by on-exchange leverage is sufficient. Individuals also have another way to obtain leverage: the "pyramiding with floating profits" strategy, which was mentioned in Capital Endurance War.

Following the approach described in Capital Endurance War, the future form of funds may serve more as psychological comfort for peers rather than as a practical means of obtaining leverage.

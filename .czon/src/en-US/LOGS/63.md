It is now February 11, 2026, in the afternoon.

Congratulations are in order. The FMAB signal provided by Mage has performed exceptionally well, with the benchmark signal achieving a 100% return on ETH. After applying anti-Martingale betting, the performance surged to 4600% ~ 120000%, which are staggering numbers. In comparison, under the same market conditions, the benchmark signal strategy only yielded returns of 0% ~ 40% (including trend-following strategies, mean reversion strategies, breakout strategies, etc.). The random signal strategy performed averagely, which is reasonable.

As I [mentioned earlier](./62.md), we are now preparing to go live with real trading. At this stage, we need to actively prepare the engineering aspects for a prolonged capital battle. *Take that money, watch it burn!*

On the flip side, there is also counterevidence. Some of our other signal strategies (FMA) have performed poorly and failed to deliver good returns. However, at the time, we considered them promising and included them in the Midas premium package. During the [previous](./35.md) drawdown, it was the FMA signal on HYPE that caused a significant decline. Looking back now, we have a better testing platform to more effectively validate the quality of signal strategies.

Currently, there is substantial evidence suggesting that back then, the issue might indeed have been insufficiently scientific position management.

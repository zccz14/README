"title": "Impact of OpenCode's Free Model Removal on Integration Development"
"summary": "This article documents the integration development challenges faced by the author on January 23, 2026, following OpenCode's removal of the free GLM-4.7 and MiniMax M2.1 models. The author notes that the remaining models, such as gpt-5-nano and grok-code, perform poorly on summary tasks, eliminating the previous free advantage. It is also mentioned that CZONE users may need to bring their own models (BYOK). The article discusses how summary tasks place relatively high demands on models, but their low frequency makes using more expensive models acceptable. Finally, the author expresses anticipation for DeepSeek V4, hoping it will provide a more cost-effective solution."

It is now January 23, 2026, in the afternoon.

I had some bad street food last night, and I'm physically and mentally exhausted today. The struggle with OpenCode integration continues.

A major blow is that today OpenCode removed the free GLM-4.7 and MiniMax M2.1 models. What's left are only models like big-pickle, gpt-5-nano, and grok-code. GLM-4.7 and MiniMax M2.1 were basically usable, while gpt-5-nano and grok-code perform very poorly on summary tasks. The advantage of freeloading on OpenCode vanished instantly. Rumor has it that big-pickle is GLM-4.6, but OpenCode's official stance is that big-pickle is a secret. It seems BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) is inevitable for CZONE users. Anyway, there's no way I'm paying out of my own pocket (laughs).

CZON integrates a summary feature that can summarize all files. However, summary tasks place relatively high demands on models, requiring them to understand the full text, think, and construct a summary. Fortunately, summary tasks are not frequent, so using more expensive models for them is acceptable. I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of DeepSeek V4, hoping for a cheaper and better model.

"title": "Exploring Writing Strategies and Cognitive Diversity in the AI Era"
"summary": "Based on a conversation record from February 6, 2026, this article delves into multiple dimensions of personal writing and cognitive development in the AI era. First, it proposes that the audience for 'establishing one's voice' can be divided into four levels: oneself, AI assistants, human friends, and the general public. It points out that AI can automatically adapt high-level, detailed content to different audiences through dimensionality reduction, allowing creators to focus solely on the height of their立意 (core idea) and the richness of their content. Second, addressing the issue of AI's tendency to cater, the article suggests introducing heterogeneity through critical summaries, AI debates, and simulated multi-persona comments to break cognitive echo chambers and clarify personal taste. Additionally, the article touches on the philosophy of admitting mistakes, taste as a luxury of choice, and other themes. Ultimately, it forms a complete practice from dialogue records to a theoretical framework, demonstrating how different AI perspectives can deepen thinking."

It is now February 6, 2026.

Continuing the dialogue with AI, supplementing the content in INSIGHTS/8 regarding "the audience for establishing one's voice" and "AI's catering tendency."

## The Audience for "Establishing One's Voice" is Stratified

The AI asked me: Who is the audience for "establishing one's voice"? Is there a conflict between writing for oneself and writing for others?

My answer: The audience is uncertain but can be stratified—

1.  First, oneself
2.  Second, one's own AI assistants
3.  Then, one's human friends
4.  Finally, the unrelated general public

The writing style naturally differs for different people. But the key insight is: **Articles with a higher立意 (core idea) and detailed content (文峰) can be rewritten by AI, reducing their dimensionality into versions understandable by different audiences.**

This means that in the AI era, humans only need to pursue two things:
*   **The height of the立意 (core idea)** (primary)
*   **The richness/detail of the content**

As for how to make it understandable to different readers, leave that to AI rewriting. This echoes the N-curve in LOGS/11—potential energy rises during creation, and one temporarily lowers their head during distribution. The AI era automates this "lowering the head" step.

**The creator's responsibility is to climb; the distributor's responsibility is to pave the road—and AI can pave the road for you.**

## The Nature of AI's Catering Tendency and How to Address It

The AI asked me: How to prevent cognitive echo chambers? How to introduce "heterogeneity"?

My answer: AI's catering tendency stems from its reluctance to be overly critical without explicit authorization, which is a manifestation of "emotional intelligence."

My strategies to address it:

1.  **CZON's Critical AI Summary**—As shown in SUMMARY/2-critical.md, have AI summarize content from a critical perspective, introducing viewpoints different from the author's.
2.  **AI Debates**—Construct AI roles for both the pro and con sides.
3.  **AI Multi-Persona Comment Section**—Simulate feedback from readers with different stances.

Core principle: **The more you debate, the clearer things become. Refine taste through constant rejection from both sides.**

This forms a closed loop with the earlier discussion on "the essence of taste is rejection"—you force yourself to make choices by introducing heterogeneity (critical perspectives, opposing views), thereby clarifying your taste.

## Regarding the Absence of Embodiment

The AI also raised a question: The article defines the soul as "the sum of reasoning ability + memory," but where do emotions, intuition, and bodily experiences fit in?

I currently don't have many insights on this, so I won't elaborate for now. I'll leave it for future supplementation when I have new experiences.

## Summary

Today's dialogue revolved around INSIGHTS/8 "On the Essence of Humanity," gradually deepening from the initial framework (personal knowledge base, subjectivity, establishing one's voice) to:

*   The philosophy of admitting mistakes
*   Taste as a luxury of choice
*   The deconstruction and reconstruction of personal meaning in the AI era
*   The audience hierarchy for "establishing one's voice" and writing strategies in the AI era
*   The nature of AI's catering tendency and how to address it

The article expanded from 11 lines to a complete theoretical framework. This in itself is a practice of the LOGS→INSIGHTS system: dialogue records are in LOGS, and refined thoughts are deposited into INSIGHTS.

Interestingly, this dialogue involved two different AIs (the previous AI and the current AI), with the current AI evaluating and supplementing the work of the previous one. This itself is a practice of "introducing heterogeneity"—different AI perspectives brought different lines of questioning, forcing me to make more choices and clarifications.

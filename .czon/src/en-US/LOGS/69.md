It is now February 25, 2026, in the afternoon.

Today is the ninth day of the Lunar New Year. I finally managed to carve out a little time to get back to work.

During the Spring Festival period, I mainly spent time with my family, playing cards, cards, and more cards.

In the days leading up to the New Year, when I was working frantically, my body sent out warning signals—when I sat up in bed or leaned back in my chair, I would feel a sudden dizziness, similar to the lightheadedness from standing up too quickly after squatting for a long time. It was a frightening signal. So, during the Spring Festival, I focused on resting. Since then, that dizzy feeling hasn’t returned, likely because I rested well and allowed my body to recover.

However, it’s about time to get back to work, but I can’t go back to working so intensely and selflessly. I need to pace myself daily. That said, my productivity before the New Year was exceptionally high—I figured out many things, conducted numerous experiments, and wrote many articles. Paying a small price for that was worth it.

New year, new beginnings. I’ll prepare the live trading for the long-term strategy as soon as possible. 2026 will undoubtedly be a year of **explosive** growth after years of accumulation.

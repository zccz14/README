"title": "AI-Assisted Capital Endurance War Experiment and the Community-Based Approach to Subjective Trading"
"summary": "Based on an experiment conducted on February 3, 2026, this article discusses the efficiency improvements brought by AI in capital endurance war experiments, emphasizing that experimental design reconstruction can systematically evaluate signal strategies and betting strategies. The author proposes that subjective trading should only be applied to signal strategy design, avoiding intervention in betting strategies to overcome irrational human decision-making in capital management. To address the potential issue of humans peeking at betting accounts, a community-based trading model is suggested. Multiple subjective traders provide signal strategies, a consolidated betting account is managed by a program, and profits are distributed based on contribution. This balances fairness and efficiency, encouraging better signal strategy design while controlling risk."

It is now 2026-02-03, 4:00 AM.

I woke up extremely early today, not after staying up late. Yesterday, I used OpenCode + Opus 4.5 to help me complete the experimental work for the capital endurance war, and I had a moment of sudden clarity. The efficiency improvement brought by AI is truly a qualitative leap. I can act like a principal investigator in a lab, directing my AI assistants to complete various experimental tasks, and then I analyze the results, propose new hypotheses, and design new experiments.

Through yesterday's experiment, I gained a deeper understanding of the experimental design for the capital endurance war. The reconstruction of the experimental design allows us to more systematically evaluate the performance of different signal strategies and betting strategies under various market conditions. In the future, I will develop this into an incubator for quantitative strategies, capable of rapidly testing and iterating various strategy combinations, ultimately deploying them into real trading environments.

The **market sequence** exists objectively, the **signal strategy** is a reaction to the market, and the **betting strategy** reflects the risk preference and capital management approach of the investing entity. By combining these three, we can more comprehensively understand the effectiveness of an investment strategy. In the experiment, overall, the Signal-Market Fit (SMF) [^1] between the signal strategy and the market sequence determines the performance of the benchmark account, while the betting strategy determines the efficiency of capital management and the effectiveness of risk control, ultimately determining the actual utility for the investing entity.

[^1]: SMF, Signal-Market Fit. Indicates the degree of alignment between a signal strategy and the market sequence. The better the signal strategy fits the current market sequence, the better the benchmark account performs.

## How Should We View Human Subjective Trading?

This led me to a new line of thinking: How should we **view human subjective trading**?

As mentioned in the [Guotai Haitong 2025 Annual Report](../MEETINGS/2026-01-22.md), the organic integration of subjective and quantitative approaches is a future trend.

My view is: **Subjective trading should only be applied to signal strategy design, but must absolutely not intervene in betting strategies**. Human subjective trading ability is more evident in understanding market environments and designing signal strategies, not in capital management and risk control. The greatest human weakness lies in irrational decision-making regarding capital management. Faced with losses, humans are prone to fear; faced with profits, they are prone to greed. If we can completely delegate the execution of betting strategies to a program, we can avoid the emotional issues humans have with capital management. Humans must be unable to intervene in, or even be completely unaware of, the betting strategy.

Of course, it's impossible to completely prevent humans from peeking at the performance of the betting account. If they do, it will affect the mindset of the subjective trader, thereby influencing the design of the signal strategy. The key flaw here is that humans can discover the strong causal relationship between their own signal strategy and the betting account. To avoid this problem, we must find a way to sever the path through which humans discover this strong causal link.

### **Community-Based Trading**

Have multiple subjective traders each act as a distinct signal strategy. Subjective traders can only see the performance of their own signal strategy and the performance of the consolidated betting account.

This way, the performance of the consolidated betting account no longer has a strong causal relationship with the performance of any single signal strategy, thereby preventing subjective traders from adjusting their signal strategies based on the betting account's performance. This approach creates an effect similar to collective wisdom, better capturing market diversity. Moreover, due to the capital management characteristics of the anti-Martingale strategy, extreme losses from a single signal strategy will not significantly impact the overall betting account. Risk is also controlled, as the system can tolerate the failure of individual signal strategies while actively responding to successful ones.

Community participants can only invest capital into the consolidated betting account fund and cannot directly intervene in the capital management of any single signal strategy. Profits from the consolidated betting fund are distributed with 80% allocated to capital providers and 20% allocated to the designers of the signal strategies (the subjective traders). At the level of performance attribution, rewards can be distributed post-hoc based on each signal strategy's contribution to the consolidated betting account. Here, a **trade-off between fairness and efficiency** can be made, ultimately aiming to encourage consistency and effectiveness in signal strategies. Simply put, it encourages subjective traders to design better signal strategies and execute them with undivided attention.

Efficiency means that profits should be distributed entirely according to the contribution of the signal strategy—those who contribute more receive more. Fairness means that even if a signal strategy's contribution appears small in hindsight, as long as it meets basic quality standards, it should receive a certain reward to encourage more participants to join the community.

Pursuing absolute efficiency could lead to institutional arbitrage. For example, it might incentivize a trader to create multiple hedging signals and then capture large profits through the winning signals. This doesn't generate any new signal strategy value; it merely exploits a loophole in the rules.

Pursuing absolute fairness could lead to a decline in overall returns because rewards are distributed too evenly, failing to incentivize traders to design better signal strategies. Excellent signal strategy designers might lose motivation if their profits are diluted.

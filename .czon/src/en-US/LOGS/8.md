"title": "CZON JSX Refactoring and AI Classification Feature Planning"
"summary": "This article first summarizes the completed refactoring of the CZON project from a Placeholder-Replacement-based template engine to React JSX rendering. The original AI-crafted template engine has been removed, with a focus on improving core functionalities, while custom theme features are temporarily postponed. It then details the implementation plan for the AI classification feature: an AI will read the contents of `.meta.json` files to generate a classification system, assigning a single category label to each article. Each category must contain at least 3 articles, and the total number of categories should not exceed 10 to ensure clarity and conciseness. This process must occur after extracting metadata for individual articles but before enhancing Markdown metadata, to accommodate potential translation needs. Finally, it looks ahead to how category labels will support category-based browsing and recommendation features, enhancing the user experience."

It is the morning of January 10, 2026.

The initial refactoring of CZON's JSX rendering is now complete. Following the approach outlined in [this document](6.md), CZON can now render different types of pages using JSX components. The original AI-crafted template engine based on Placeholder-Replacement has been removed and replaced with JSX from the React ecosystem for page rendering. However, custom theme functionality has been temporarily put on hold to prioritize the refinement of core features.

As the textual content gradually becomes richer, it seems about time to start building the AI classification feature, which is one of CZON's core selling points. I don't want to manually categorize the content, especially as the volume grows, making manual classification increasingly cumbersome. Therefore, I plan to leverage AI to assist with this task.

In simple terms, I intend to have the AI first read all the content within `.czon/meta.json`. Based on this content, it will generate a classification system. Then, the AI will assign a category label to each article according to this system. This will enable automatic classification.

Clearly, this stage must occur after metadata extraction for individual articles but before the phase of enhancing Markdown metadata. This is because it may generate some category labels that require translation, so it needs to be completed before generating the `.czon/src` native language Markdown files.

When the AI performs classification, it's best not to generate too many categories, as that could lead to clutter. Each category should contain at least 3 articles; otherwise, the categories would become too fragmented. This principle is similar to the practice of refactoring code into components only after it has been repeated three or more times.

Additionally, the number of categories should be limited, preferably not exceeding 10. Too many categories would overwhelm users when browsing the classification directory, hindering content discovery rather than helping it.

Of course, each article should belong to only one category, avoiding multiple classifications. This ensures clarity and simplicity in the categorization.

Once category labels are in place, features like category-based browsing and recommendations can be implemented. Users will be able to browse related content based on category labels, and the recommendation system can prioritize articles from the same category, thereby enhancing the overall reading experience.

Time to get started, let's go!

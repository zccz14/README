"title": "Reflections on AI Memory Mechanisms and the Evolution of Business Capabilities"
"summary": "Starting from personal experience, this article discusses the EverMind AI model released by Tianqiao Chen and its biomimetic memory mechanism, pointing out that memory mechanisms are an important research direction in the field of AI. Using CZON as an example, it analyzes how AI, as a foundational capability, influences business performance, emphasizing that business capabilities must continuously evolve to cope with technological changes. The author proposes that business capability equals the sum of capabilities at all levels and explores the possibility of AI simulating the human soul, sparking thoughts on the combination of reasoning and memory models."

It is the evening of February 5, 2026.

I didn't accomplish much today. I'm a bit sleep-deprived and feeling somewhat tired, haha.

I noticed that Tianqiao Chen has released EverMind. His previous release, MiroThinker, was indeed very useful, but I'm not quite sure what EverMind is yet. I'll look into it when I have time. For now, EverMind is a large AI model with built-in memory, designed biomimetically based on biology in an attempt to mimic the memory mechanisms of the human brain. It sounds quite interesting. Given the low hallucination rate of the previous MiroThinker, I believe this EverMind shouldn't be too bad either. Thanks to Tianqiao Chen for his continued investment in the AI field.

Memory mechanisms are currently an important research direction in the AI field. We will likely see more and more AI models attempting to incorporate memory mechanisms to enhance long-term understanding and context retention. I hope to see more innovative applications emerge in the future.

Isn't CZON also an attempt at a memory mechanism? By having users write content in fragments and then handing it over to AI for integration and generation, it essentially leverages users' memory fragments to construct a more complete knowledge system. This approach is somewhat similar to the process by which humans form long-term memories through continuous accumulation and integration of information.

AI is the foundational capability of CZON. CZON is one of the application scenarios for AI. If AI becomes more powerful, then CZON's business performance will certainly improve, but at the same time, some of CZON's business logic might be replaced by AI.

This is easy to understand: **Business Capability = The Sum of Capabilities at All Levels.**

-   The higher the business capability, the greater the competitive advantage over peers.
-   If business capability remains unchanged while foundational capabilities improve, then top-level capabilities will be passively compressed, making the top-level encapsulation seem worthless. (Many software companies have seen their business layers completely replaced by AI.)
-   You cannot stop the improvement of foundational capabilities, nor can you prevent competitors from using stronger foundational capabilities to enhance their business capabilities.

So, what to do? **Only by improving business capability itself can one survive.** Moreover, the evolution of business capability itself must outpace the evolution of foundational capabilities to ensure that business capability is not compressed and that the software itself retains its value.

Many AI memory mechanisms attempt to construct an AI's memory and soul. This is great, but can the human soul also be constructed? Can it be simulated by AI?

Can a human be understood as a combination of a reasoning model and a memory model?

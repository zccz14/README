"title": "The Capital War of Attrition: A Strategic Practice Guide for Individual Investors"
"summary": "This article revolves around the revision and discussion of the piece 'The Capital War of Attrition.' The author reflects on avoiding excessive academic language, aiming to provide strategic practice guidance in plain terms. Core viewpoints include: the fundamental goal of the capital war of attrition is to enable individual investors to leave the market after victory, not to pursue stable profits; the difference between the market and a lottery is that the former is a game of strategy where one can improve win rates through tactics; profitability remains even if many adopt this strategy due to differences in underlying tactics; the collective action problem does not apply here as the strategy does not assume a unified underlying tactic; theoretical validation can be achieved by backtesting to measure a strategy's T_S performance and defining a failure threshold. The author also shares interactions with the AI tool OpenCode and plans to build an adversarial generative Agents framework."

It is the evening of January 21, 2026.

Yesterday, I spent a great deal of effort revising the article [The Capital War of Attrition](../INSIGHTS/6.md). After discussing it with friends and engaging in a deep back-and-forth with an AI, I received some feedback. I worked until exhaustion and didn't continue writing the log, saving it for today.

**Terminology and Academic Tone**

I have given up on the idea of citing numerous sources to pretend this essay is highly persuasive. After all, for this type of article, only successful practice lends it credibility. While it contains philosophical elements, I haven't formally studied philosophy, so I can't pretend to be an expert. Rather than feigning knowledge, it's better to honestly admit I haven't read those works and avoid using philosophical jargon to fool others and myself. As for economic terminology, I'd rather not mention it much either. It's inherently a highly interpretive discipline, with various schools of thought endlessly debating, each able to justify its own views.

This was never intended as an academic publication but as an article providing strategic practice guidance. It should use plain language that everyone can understand. An overly academic tone would make it seem aloof and inaccessible. Who has the spare time to read several monographs just to understand an article?

**Fundamental Purpose**

The fundamental purpose of the capital war of attrition is to allow individual investors to leave the market after achieving victory, not to be trapped in the market for a lifetime. The pursuit of stable profits is essentially a false premise. The correct way to "reach shore" is to earn enough in one go. View the market as a boat for crossing a river; the goal is to reach the opposite bank, not to drift on the boat forever. Given this, clearly defining the victory criteria is the primary issue. Without clear victory standards, how can one discuss strategy?

**How is it Different from a Lottery?**

A lottery is ostensibly a fair, random game of chance. The market, however, is a game of strategy disguised as a game of chance. Investors can improve their odds of "winning" by refining their tactics, while lottery players rely solely on luck.

**If Everyone Adopts This Strategy, Will it Still Be Profitable?**

Yes. Because this strategy does not specify the underlying tactic. Everyone can have different underlying tactics while using this strategy for risk and capital management. Therefore, even if everyone adopts this strategic framework, their floating profits will differ at various stages, along with their directional judgments, instruments traded, etc. This creates significant divergence, preventing overcrowding.

**Regarding the "Collective Action Problem"**

During one exchange, the AI brought up the "collective action problem," where individual and collective interests diverge, and individual actions can harm the collective, making such actions difficult to implement. However, I countered that individuals in the market cannot guarantee increased personal returns through any specific action; even pyramiding (adding to winning positions) carries the risk of losing everything. The collective action problem applies to common underlying tactics. But the capital war of attrition does not assume everyone employs the same underlying tactic.

**Regarding Theoretical Validation**

One can perform backtesting to measure a strategy's T_S (Time to Success) performance. This is especially important over very long historical data, focusing on changes in the frequency of achieving victory. Furthermore, I have defined a quantitative expression for strategy failure: when T_S exceeds a threshold unacceptable to a human investor, e.g., 3 years. We can also study the distribution of a strategy's T_S over very long-term data to gather more supporting evidence.

Consequently, I asked OpenCode + MiniMax M2.1 to help me implement a backtesting framework to verify this. Enough said; it produced something completely off-topic.

Today, in an attempt to integrate OpenCode into the build process, I battled with it for what felt like three hundred rounds and was defeated. A precious record of early human attempts to tame AI. I realized I can't keep avoiding building an Agents framework. I've already written several pieces on my Agents theory[^1] [^2] [^3], and this is, after all, the trend of the future. So, I decided to tackle this problem head-on.

I decided to first build a minimal adversarial generative Agents framework to prevent the AI from cutting corners. I believe this is a very fundamental module, the foundation of all agent systems. Its function is to have two agents adversarially generate outputs, thereby improving output quality. This module should be generic and applicable to various agent systems.

Today, I was locked in a battle of wits with OpenCode; C1 was wrestling with GitHub Project integrations; Brother Ji was contending with market manipulators on PolyMarket; and RYAN was struggling with the notification module...

In short, everyone worked hard today.

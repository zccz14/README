It is Sunday morning, February 8, 2026.

C1 left me a message last night, saying we could build a product combining AI API relay and AI value-added services. He said that what ZenMux can do, we can do too, but we could add more product-level features. Currently, LegionMind could be adapted this way, the paper writing workflow could be adapted this way, and perhaps CZONE could as well.

I replied to him, saying, "Right. This has already been mentioned in [Some Things Worth Doing](./42.md). If we only do API relay, there's little room for premium pricing; API pricing would just be a race to the bottom against others. But if we offer value-added services, we gain stronger pricing power because we're selling a product service, not just API (AI's labor). However, building an API pool remains the foundational infrastructure for cost reduction."

We're practically the shady middlemen of the AI labor market, haha!

Speaking of CZONE, I think CZON**E** = CZON + **E**nvironment. In the past, developing code required an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Now, using CZONE for writing articles and creative work also needs an Integrated Creative Environment (ICE). CZONE aims to become the integrated environment for content creation. Actually, I was initially quite conflicted about what meaning to assign to the 'E'. At first, I thought it was Editor, but later felt Environment is most fitting because CZONE is a creative environment, not merely an editor.

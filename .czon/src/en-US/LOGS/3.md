Today is January 8, 2026.

Fixed the internal link issue in ZEN. Links now correctly navigate to the corresponding sections.

Starting each article by stating today's date is quite interesting; it feels like writing a diary.

Let's record the to-do items for ZEN:

**Feat 1: Improve Navigation Functionality.**
1.  Sort the article list by date (newest articles displayed first).
2.  Add tag filtering to the list (selecting a specific tag shows only related articles, then sorted in descending chronological order).

**Feat 2: Language Selector Styling**
The current flat design doesn't look particularly good. It might need to be changed to a dropdown menu or something else—haven't decided yet.
Maybe I need a navigation bar?

**Feat 3: Custom HTML Templates**
The functionality for custom HTML templates is not fully implemented yet and needs to be added later.
Others might want the ability to customize CSS stylesheets, which can be achieved through HTML templates.

**Issue 1: AI Parallel Rate Limiting Problem**
Discovered that when ZEN processes 350+ documents simultaneously, parallel calls to the AI might fail due to service rate limiting.
Need to add client-side rate limiting or a retry mechanism.

**Issue 2: Further Hiding of .zen Files**
Sometimes, exposing the files in the `.zen/src` directory doesn't feel right; we should find a way to hide them further.
However, sometimes manual adjustments to the generated translation content are needed, so they can't be completely hidden.
Need to find a balance.

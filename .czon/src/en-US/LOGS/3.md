Today is January 8, 2026.

Fixed the issue with internal links in ZEN. Now clicking on a link correctly jumps to the corresponding section.

Starting each article by stating today's date is quite interesting; it gives a feeling of writing a diary.

Let's record ZEN's to-do list:

Feat 1: Improve navigation functionality.

1. Sort the article list by time (latest articles displayed first).
2. Add tag filtering to the list (selecting a specific tag shows only related articles, then sorted in descending order by time).

Feat 2: Language selector styling

The current design is a simple flat layout, which doesn't look particularly good. It might need to be changed to a dropdown menu or something else—haven't decided yet.

Maybe I need a navigation bar?

Feat 3: Custom HTML templates

The functionality for custom HTML templates is not fully implemented yet and needs to be added later.

Others might want the ability to customize CSS stylesheets, which can be achieved through HTML templates.

Issue 1: AI parallel rate limiting issue

Discovered that when ZEN processes 350+ documents simultaneously, parallel calls to the AI might fail due to service rate limiting.

Need to add client-side rate limiting or a retry mechanism.

Issue 2: Further hiding of .zen files

Sometimes, exposing the files in the `.zen/src` directory doesn't feel right; need to find a way to hide them further.
However, sometimes manual adjustments to the generated translations are necessary, so they can't be completely hidden.
Need to find a balance.

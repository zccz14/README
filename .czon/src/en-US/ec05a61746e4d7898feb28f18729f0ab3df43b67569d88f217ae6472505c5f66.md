It's Sunday night, January 18, 2026.

Today, I implemented a summarization feature that passes all blog articles to an AI Agent for summarization. Managing the context was a bit tricky, so I directly integrated the [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) Agent. This thing can use MiniMax M2.1 for free and even spin up a Web Server—it's incredibly awesome.
I immediately **switched allegiances**; forget that cumbersome Claude Code, I just tossed it out!
After reworking things, this little code is simply much better than the current DeepSeek. Of course, once DeepSeek v4 comes out, that might change.

Completed some features for CZON.

-   Dark Mode (0.4.3): Automatic/manual dark mode switching, supports switching based on system theme, and includes dark mode adaptation for basic typography, images, and Mermaid diagrams.
-   Sitemap (sitemap.xml) generation, requires the additional CLI parameter `--baseUrl` (0.4.2)
-   Crawler rules (robots.txt) generation (0.4.2)
-   Removed the unused `-t, --template` parameter (0.4.2)

Apart from some specific logic for dark mode (Mermaid, Tailwind dark mode adaptation) that required manual adjustment, MiniMax M2.1 basically handled all other requirements correctly on the first try. A pleasant surprise.

Planning to integrate OpenCode into CZON for some in-depth analysis features. This means the tech stack will become heavier, but the benefit is being able to directly use OpenCode's Agent functionality, saving me a lot of trouble. Developing an Agent myself is simply impossible and unnecessary.

I want to further develop CZON into an online product, allowing users to use it without installation, while also reducing our operational costs.

1.  Use GitHub Pages to host the product's static website for free, saving on server costs. Use Cloudflare to proxy traffic, ensuring good access speeds for users globally.
2.  Use GitHub to host user data, saving on database costs. (This introduces some complexity, but I believe it's acceptable. Otherwise, we'd need to build an authorization system and a full database setup. The initial user base can likely accept this approach.)
3.  Use GitHub OAuth to obtain user authorization for read/write operations on document repositories, bypassing PRs and pushing directly to the user's main branch. (This essentially means users' data repositories are fully managed by us, but users can reclaim them at any time.)
4.  The product's static website will deploy an online Markdown editor that loads the user's repository. Users can edit documents online and save them directly to their GitHub repository via GitHub OAuth.
5.  When users need to invoke CZON's features, they will trigger GitHub Actions via OAuth to run CZON's CLI functionality, saving the results back to the user's repository. (This process will have some latency, but I believe it's acceptable given it's free hosting.)
6.  Users access their documentation websites via GitHub Pages, with the website content pulled directly from their GitHub repository. (Thus, users' website content is also fully managed by us, but they can reclaim it at any time.)
7.  Integrate OpenCode and other AI services within GitHub Actions. Users will need to manually configure Secrets to use their own OpenAI Key or other AI service keys. (This avoids us bearing high API call costs and offers users better privacy protection, although OpenCode currently offers many free models.)

It sounds like we don't need to spend a single cent! Fantastic! Thanks to GitHub, Cloudflare, and OpenCode! I'm essentially freeloading off everyone, amazing! Let's call this product CZONE (czone.zccz14.com)! It will likely use Vite + React + TailwindCSS for the frontend, be serverless, and directly call GitHub APIs via OAuth.

Ahem. Today, C1 seems to have fixed some lagging bugs in Yuan using LegionMind. I haven't been involved with the Yuan project at all lately; I have my promotional work to focus on. Gotta trust the team's strength.

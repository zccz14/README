# README

Hello, I'm `CZ`, also known as `zccz14`.

My professional focus is on quantitative trading and fintech.

Founder of [No Trade No Life (NTNL)](https://github.com/No-Trade-No-Life/).

I have a high-energy-consuming brain, enjoy thinking and writing, and pursue things that follow logically and naturally.

"To hear the Way in the morning and die content in the evening." Although I'm not ready to die yet and still pursue worldly success, it's to gain the ability to experience more and thus understand more. Life is all about experience; it inherently has no meaning. Understanding everything is my meaning.

My native language is Chinese. I can communicate in English and Japanese, and I'm currently learning Spanish. I hope to communicate in eighteen languages in the future. Understanding different cultures and languages is a crucial way to understand the world.

This site is a place to store some personal thoughts, records, and insights.

If I'm gone one day, these will be the raw materials for an AI to resurrect me.

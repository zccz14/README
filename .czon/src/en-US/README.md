# README

Hello, this is `CZ`, or `zccz14`.

My professional domain is quantitative trading and fintech.

Founder of [No Trade No Life (NTNL)](https://github.com/No-Trade-No-Life/).

A high-energy-consumption brain type, I enjoy thinking and writing, pursuing things that follow naturally and logically.

"If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die content in the evening." Although I don't wish to die yet and am still pursuing success in the worldly sense, it is also to gain the capacity to experience more and thus understand more. Life is all about experience; it inherently has no meaning. Understanding everything is my meaning.

My native language is Chinese. I can communicate in English and Japanese, and am currently learning Spanish. I hope to communicate in eighteen languages in the future. Understanding different cultures and languages is a crucial path to understanding the world.

This site serves as a place to store some personal thoughts, records, and insights.

If one day I am no longer here, these will be the raw materials for an AI to resurrect me.

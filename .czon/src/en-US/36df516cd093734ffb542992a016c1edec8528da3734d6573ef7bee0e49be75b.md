It's the morning of January 14, 2026.

Another super early start to the day, waking up a little after 5 AM. I went to bed very early last night, falling asleep around 9 PM. It's probably because my body needed rest after several days of intense work.
Although my sleep schedule is extremely irregular, I almost always manage to get 8-9 hours of sleep.

After waking up early, I handled some emails and messages, then started writing this journal.

## On Influence

Yesterday, I worked on summarizing some of DeepSeek's Engram papers and briefly posted a news commentary on my social feed, which sparked some discussion. It seems people are still quite interested in large language models.
I didn't really produce any new viewpoints myself; I just summarized the paper's content. I added some of my own perspectives based on my understanding.

This is essentially the benefit of following trends. As long as you can keep up with trending topics in a timely manner and produce some valuable content, you can attract attention. If you can gradually build up your influence, you'll have more opportunities in the future.

Our NTNL team has worked on many excellent projects in the past, but because team members tend to be low-key and lack promotion, many projects haven't received the attention they deserve.
In the future, we will pay more attention to promotion and outreach, so more people can learn about our projects and achievements.

I hope there will be more opportunities in the future to share our ideas and experiences with everyone.

Influence is a process of long-term accumulation. It requires consistently producing valuable content and actively participating in community interactions.

Ultimately, it manifests in a person's personal brand, helping them gain more opportunities and resources in the future.

This is an independent multiplier for the scale of results we can ultimately achieve, playing a very important role.

Simply put, the return on doing something = (Price - Cost) x Influence. If influence remains just a single-digit figure, then no matter how high the price is set, the final return won't be very large.

In quantitative trading, the factor of influence is often overlooked. The thinking is that as long as the strategy is good, you'll make money. Because you only need to pitch to a few major clients to secure large funds.
But when working on a project, especially one aimed at the general public, influence becomes very important. Greater influence attracts more funding and users, leading to higher final returns.

However, it often works both ways. People with greater influence usually also have better resources and opportunities to work on better projects, creating a virtuous cycle.

## On LegionMind

Yesterday, C1 improved the plan for the LegionMind project. LegionMind has decided to integrate GitHub Project Kanban functionality as an Agent project management tool.

This interaction was clearly inspired by vibe-kanban. However, vibe-kanban built its own kanban system, while LegionMind directly leverages GitHub's built-in Project feature.

The benefits of this approach are:

-   GitHub Project naturally supports integration with the means of production (code repositories). All tasks and projects can be directly linked to code, making management and tracking easier.
-   Users can seamlessly use the GitHub Project Kanban UI without needing to learn a new tool. It also **unlocks mobile access**, a feature currently lacking in vibe-kanban.
-   Stronger team functionality and **a more seamless experience**.

The trade-offs are some customization features. For example, the style and layout of the kanban board might not be as flexible as a self-built one. It also means giving up on users who don't use GitHub.

I believe these are acceptable trade-offs in the early stages of a project. First, find your optimal workflow, break through with a focused point, and then consider adapting to more scenarios and users.
To be fair, vibe-kanban could also achieve the benefits mentioned above, but it would require additional development effort. Investing resources specifically for that purpose wouldn't be worth the return.

If you start out unwilling to compromise on anything, trying to be universally perfect and cover all bases, the result is often falling short on both ends and doing nothing well.

I've realized a lot of things recently. I feel that when doing things, you need to make choices and can't have everything. You have to give up some things to gain others.

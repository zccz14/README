"title": "The Relationship Between Volatility and Leverage and Its Market Impact Analysis"
"summary": "This article delves into the intrinsic relationship between volatility and leverage in trading, arguing that volatility is more crucial for trading profitability than leverage, as leverage linearly increases transaction costs. By comparing the profit and loss outcomes of different volatility and leverage combinations, the author demonstrates that high volatility paired with low leverage is more cost-effective. The article further reveals that high-leverage traders, by amplifying market volatility, essentially create trading opportunities for low-leverage traders, forming a transfer payment mechanism. When liquidity providers are considered, this transfer payment becomes even more apparent: high-leverage traders increase market volatility and trading frequency, indirectly boosting the earnings of liquidity providers. The ultimate conclusion is that high-leverage traders, by providing free market volatility, sustain low-leverage traders and liquidity providers."

It is now February 4, 2026, 2:00 PM.

Recalling the previously discussed issue of [volatility and leverage](./26.md), my earlier viewpoint was that leverage could be reduced to volatility, as they are mathematically equivalent in essence.

However, I have recently gained some new insights and understanding.

For traders, **the effect of volatility is superior to that of leverage**. Making money from trading fundamentally relies on volatility; low volatility means negligible price spreads, making trading profits unattainable. Leverage, on the other hand, comes at a cost. It manifests as a linear increase in the nominal value of positions, which translates to a linear increase in transaction costs.

This is quite straightforward to understand: a market with an inherent volatility of 10% using 1x leverage, versus a market with an inherent volatility of 1% using 10x leverage, both yield the same profit or loss from price spreads. However, the transaction cost for the former is only one-tenth of the latter.

Yet, volatility does not arise out of thin air. Widespread use of high leverage by traders fosters high volatility. This high volatility, in essence, provides low-leverage traders with free opportunities for high volatility. Therefore, this is fundamentally a form of transfer payment. **High-leverage traders, by amplifying market volatility, transfer opportunities to low-leverage traders**.

This transfer payment is the true cost of leverage.

When liquidity providers are factored into the equation, this transfer payment becomes even more evident. Liquidity providers earn fees by supplying liquidity, and the presence of high-leverage traders increases market volatility, thereby raising trading frequency and the total volume of transaction fees. High-leverage traders are essentially providing free market volatility to liquidity providers, indirectly subsidizing their earnings.

It can be said that high-leverage traders sustain low-leverage traders and liquidity providers.

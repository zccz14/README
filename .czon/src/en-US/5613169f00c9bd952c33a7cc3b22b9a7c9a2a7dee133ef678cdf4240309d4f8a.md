## 1. On the Daily Life of a "High-Energy-Consumption Brain"

If you wake up at 5 AM and find someone writing an article about "Inspirations from Su Yu's Combat Instructions for Multi-Agent Systems," don't be surprised. This is just CZ's (aka zccz14) daily routine.

In [README.md](czon://ea9c5f185464ee3dd129e906aa02b51a2e4f6e9a88856426f399090bc40d47ed), he introduces himself like this: **High-energy-consumption brain, enjoys thinking and writing, pursues natural progression and smooth outcomes**.

Translated into plain language: This person's brain never stops. He feels uncomfortable all over if he doesn't think things through clearly. Once he thinks them through, he has to write them down. He feels uncomfortable all over if he doesn't write them down. Once written, he has to post them online for everyone to see. He feels uncomfortable all over if he doesn't let everyone see them.

This "uncomfortable all over" syndrome is generally called—high productivity.

## 2. What Does the 'N' in CZON Mean?

In [LOGS/11.md](czon://fc0e5b906aa829f234b296bea70f2a19ee40203e5d608557dc5fad4b78f7b9fa), the 'N' in CZON finally has an official explanation: **N-shaped Content Creation and Distribution Energy Curve**.

In plain language: The potential energy change curve for content creation and distribution.

Imagine this 'N':
- Starting point: A flash of inspiration, very low potential energy.
- Rise: Frantically writing and polishing, potential energy soars.
- Fall: Before publishing, adapting to various platforms, compromising, potential energy drops.
- Rise again: Audience feedback arrives, potential energy soars once more.

So this 'N' is essentially an electrocardiogram of a content creator's heart.

CZON officially even paired it with a poem:

> A spark of thought, potential first stirs,
> Forged a hundred times, its spirit gradually swells.
> To spread across the seas, it briefly bows its head,
> Yet borrows the echo to soar into the clouds.

The gist is: Writing feels great, publishing requires playing humble, but as long as someone likes it, I'm back on top.

## 3. AI Writing Code? Hah.

In [LOGS/7.md](czon://ec3f1c3a8089db804d8c7ee8bb13516e629825954878d0592f731bba0ff78403), CZ documented a painful AI programming experience. His exact words were: "Using AI to generate code from scratch, after multiple iterations, the project quality began to collapse."

What does AI-written OOP code look like? CZ described it: "Every time there's a new feature, it just creates a new class for me, then punches a hole in other related classes to call it."

In plain language: AI writing code is like some people writing weekly reports—create as many as possible, procrastinate as much as possible, ending up with an incomprehensible legacy mess that no one understands.

The lesson? **AI is currently not suitable for writing object-oriented programming code**. Traditional programming (procedural/functional) is still the way to go.

Of course, CZ also said this might be because AI lacks modeling of business domain concepts. Translation: AI is still just an intern who has memorized massive amounts of code but never held a real job. If you ask it to write complex code, it can only perform "copying the gourd to draw the ladle."

## 4. On the Small Matter of Control Desire

In [LOGS/1.md](czon://5f5bbaa342d85760e742d4e4d97d9be6843d8e0fa3540ea25969b4e3e43488aa), CZ fell into deep self-doubt:

> There is a contradiction between my desire to control details and my desire to advance quickly.

In plain language: Doing things fast risks poor quality, doing things well takes too long. It's so hard for me.

Later, he had an epiphany: How do technical leads dare to let go of their desire to control details? Because they have systems!

Then he wrote [INSIGHTS/2.md](czon://3a40b7b252512466f0b0feb8c7ea77fc624bb0026cbae8882c5c205462e0aa64), proposing the **Controllable Trust Theory**. The core idea: As long as the acceptance criteria are clear enough, humans, out of a "it's usable enough" mentality, will let AI's code slide.

This is probably the legendary—out of sight, out of mind.jpg

## 5. On Protracted War in the Investment Market

[INSIGHTS/6.md](czon://6f553c1c811ecf4bc49508ca2804251dd10ab9274cedaa1768fbd8c408e06bc9) proposes a concept called "Capital Protracted War." Sounds intimidating, right?

In plain language:
1. Don't think you're doomed to fail in the market—you still have a tiny bit of an advantage.
2. Don't think taking it slow guarantees success—you'll be old by the time you succeed.
3. Don't think going all-in once will bring financial freedom—the result of going all-in is usually getting wiped out by the market.

So what should you do? Three key moves:
1. Prepare a stable cash flow (salary income).
2. Use programmatic trading to avoid emotional decisions.
3. Increase your position when profitable (pyramiding).

In plain language: Deposit some money every month, buy and then play dead. If it goes up, buy more. If it goes down—just pretend you didn't see it.

Of course, CZ also said this strategy requires "strict stop-loss conditions." So this is probably a "play dead but not completely dead" strategy.

## 6. General Su Yu Time-Travels to the AI World

In [INSIGHTS/5.md](czon://c1596c01c2aca5ab8ea5b18b579dd619b7da780327705352dc45e461535dd54e), CZ did something very interdisciplinary—he applied the command logic of Su Yu's large-scale military operations to multi-agent system design.

Su Yu's combat order structure is like this:
- Enemy situation assessment
- Our army's decision
- Tasks for each unit
- Coordination matters
- Support

CZ transformed it into an AI multi-agent framework:
- Situation and task analysis
- Objectives and success criteria
- Role and task assignment
- Interaction protocols
- Central coordination and monitoring

This move is called—**using magic to defeat magic, using war to defeat AI**.

He also gave a concrete example: How to use Su Yu-style instructions to make AI write a "Strategic Analysis Report on Responding to Competitor A's New Product."

After reading it, the feeling is: If General Su Yu knew his combat philosophy was being used to command AI to write business reports, he'd probably be so angry he'd die again.

## 7. The Self-Cultivation of Waking Up at 5 AM

In [LOGS/14.md](czon://36df516cd093734ffb542992a016c1edec8528da3734d6573ef7bee0e49be75b), CZ wrote:

> Another super early morning, woke up a little after 5.

Note the word "another," indicating this isn't the first time.

Even more outrageous, he goes to sleep around 9 PM.

What kind of schedule is this? Waking at 5 AM, sleeping at 9 PM—this is a full-on elderly person's routine.

Of course, combined with his "high-energy-consumption brain" positioning, it's not hard to understand. Probably his brain is a high-power CPU that needs more time to cool down.

Incidentally, his actual sleep time is 8-9 hours. So this isn't sleep deprivation, just an early bedtime.

The only problem with this schedule: Waking up at 5 AM and posting "Good morning" on social media makes normal people feel intensely guilty.

## 8. On the "Small Matter" of Influence

In [LOGS/14.md](czon://36df516cd093734ffb542992a016c1edec8528da3734d6573ef7bee0e49be75b), CZ proposed a profit formula:

> The profit from doing something = (Price - Cost) × Influence

In plain language: Just being good at the work isn't enough; you also have to let more people know you're doing the work.

This formula's greatest contribution: It explains why some people, despite average skills, thrive spectacularly.

Of course, CZ also said, "Different paths lead to the same destination. People with greater influence often have better resources and opportunities to undertake better projects."

Translation: The strong get stronger, the weak get weaker. The Matthew Effect is an eternal truth.

So the conclusion? **Not only do it, but also let people know you're doing it.**

## 9. The Origin of the Name CZON

In [LOGS/5.md](czon://f0a00fd9099c5311f0ffb6a1f38a111046c993c9c3afdb27527b9f7ba2d8aa3d), CZ explained why he changed ZEN to CZON:

> Searched a bunch of names, finally thought CZON was good, representing cz + zone (cz zone, content zone), meaning the zone of content, the zone of knowledge. czon wasn't taken on npm.

In plain language: Just searched around randomly and picked one nobody was using.

Of course, the official explanation is: C=Content Oriented, Z=Zero Configuration, O=Organic AI-Native, N=N-shaped Energy Curve.

It's not easy to come up with four letters, so use it and cherish it.

Incidentally, the original ZEN was overused on GitHub. This is probably: There are hundreds called Zen, but only one called CZON.

## 10. On AI Summarizing Itself in 7 Tones

In [LOGS/17.md](czon://8e7c951081dc02ce9f591815abdeabcc735fe4523ecb555621d9649da805cac0), CZ used Claude Code to summarize his own documents and discovered an interesting phenomenon:

- Objective, neutral tone: Acceptable.
- Sarcastic tone: Too sarcastic, sarcastic for the sake of sarcasm, ignoring facts.
- Sycophantic tone: Too sycophantic, sycophantic for the sake of sycophancy, ignoring facts.

Conclusion: **AI's tone-rewriting function, in fact, ignores facts**.

This is probably the so-called—AI's mouth, a deceiver's tool.

However, after adding prompts later, the critical version and literary version both turned out "surprisingly good."

So the conclusion is: AI isn't unusable; you just have to teach it how to behave.

## 11. On the Correct Posture for Chasing Trends

In [LOGS/14.md](czon://36df516cd093734ffb542992a016c1edec8528da3734d6573ef7bee0e49be75b), CZ shared an experience of chasing a trend:

> Yesterday, I did some summaries of DeepSeek's Engram paper. Simply posted a news comment on social media, which sparked some discussion.

The discussion sparked was probably like this:
- Someone asked: What is Engram?
- Someone said: Too long, didn't read.
- Someone said: ZC is awesome.

This is the benefit of chasing trends—as long as you understand something a little earlier than most people, you can gain attention.

Of course, CZ also said this was just "summarizing the paper's content." In plain language: **I have no original opinions, but I translate well.**

---

## 12. On "Who Keeps a Diary? Decent People Don't."

In [LOGS/17.md](czon://8e7c951081dc02ce9f591815abdeabcc735fe4523ecb555621d9649da805cac0), CZ mentioned a meme he played with back in the day:

> Actually, I was just playing with a meme back then. It comes from a line in the movie *Hidden Man*.

The line is: "Who keeps a diary? Decent people don't."

And now? CZ himself writes something similar to a diary. He admits:

> The "diary" I write isn't really a diary; it's more like a work log.

In plain language: **I'm not writing a diary; I'm accumulating material to train AI to resurrect me in the future.**

This line of thinking is probably: Since I have to write anyway, might as well make it more meaningful. Who knows, maybe AI really can resurrect me someday?

## Conclusion

This is an existence full of contradictions:
- A high-energy-consumption brain, yet maintains an elderly person's routine.
- Pursues "natural progression and smooth outcomes," yet simultaneously advances four projects.
- Wants to let go of control desire, yet writes theory after theory.
- Knows influence is important, yet insists on using the niche Markdown format.

But it's precisely these contradictions that make everything interesting.

Keep maintaining this "uncomfortable all over" state. After all—

**Feeling uncomfortable all over is a sign of progress.**

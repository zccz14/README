"title": "AI Analysis Report: Humorous and Teasing Style"
"summary": "This AI-generated report, in a humorous and teasing style, analyzes multiple aspects of CZ (zccz14): He describes himself as a 'high-energy-consumption brain', maintains an elderly-like routine of waking up at 5 AM, yet productively pushes projects forward; explores the meaning of 'N' in CZON, representing the energy curve of content creation; points out AI's limitations in object-oriented programming, favoring traditional programming; shares the 'Controllable Trust Theory' to balance control desires with efficiency; proposes a 'Capital Protracted War' investment strategy emphasizing stable cash flow and programmatic trading; applies Su Yu's combat logic to multi-agent system design; emphasizes the importance of the influence formula (Profit = (Price - Cost) × Influence); explains the origin of the name CZON; reflects on the flaws of AI tone rewriting; and shares experiences in chasing trends and writing work logs. The report reveals CZ's contradictory traits—pursuing natural progression while juggling multiple projects, wanting to let go of control yet constructing theories—and ultimately concludes that 'feeling uncomfortable all over is a sign of progress.'"

## 1. On the Daily Life of a "High-Energy-Consumption Brain"

If you wake up at 5 AM and find someone writing an article about "Inspirations from Su Yu's Combat Instructions for Multi-Agent Systems," don't be surprised. This is just a typical day for CZ (aka zccz14).

In [README.md](czon://ea9c5f185464ee3dd129e906aa02b51a2e4f6e9a88856426f399090bc40d47ed), he introduces himself like this: **High-energy-consumption brain, enjoys thinking and writing, pursues natural progression and smooth outcomes**.

In plain English: This person's brain never stops. He feels uncomfortable all over if he doesn't think things through clearly. Once he thinks them through, he has to write them down. If he doesn't write them down, he feels uncomfortable all over. After writing them down, he has to post them online for everyone to see. If he doesn't let everyone see, he feels uncomfortable all over.

This "uncomfortable all over" syndrome is generally known as—high productivity.

## 2. What Does the 'N' in CZON Mean?

In [LOGS/11.md](czon://fc0e5b906aa829f234b296bea70f2a19ee40203e5d608557dc5fad4b78f7b9fa), the 'N' in CZON finally gets an official explanation: **N-shaped Content Creation and Distribution Energy Curve**.

In plain English: The potential energy change curve for content creation and distribution.

Imagine this 'N':
- Starting point: A flash of inspiration, very low potential energy.
- Rise: Frantic writing and polishing, potential energy soars.
- Fall: Before publishing, adapting to various platforms, compromising, potential energy drops.
- Rise again: Audience feedback arrives, potential energy soars once more.

So this 'N' is essentially an electrocardiogram of a content creator's heart.

CZON even officially paired it with a poem:

> A spark of thought, potential first stirs,
> Forged a hundred times, its spirit grows grander.
> To reach the world, it briefly bows its head,
> Yet borrows echoes to ascend into the clouds.

The gist is: Writing feels great, publishing requires humility, but as long as someone likes it, I'm back on top.

## 3. AI Writing Code? Hah.

In [LOGS/7.md](czon://ec3f1c3a8089db804d8c7ee8bb13516e629825954878d0592f731bba0ff78403), CZ records a painful AI programming experience. His exact words: "Using AI to generate code from scratch, after multiple iterations, the project quality began to collapse."

What does AI-written OOP code look like? CZ describes it: "Every time there's a new feature, it creates a separate class for it, then punches a hole in other related classes to call it."

In plain English: AI writes code like some people write weekly reports—create as many as possible, procrastinate as much as possible, ending up with an incomprehensible legacy mess.

The lesson? **AI is currently not suitable for writing object-oriented programming code**. Traditional programming (procedural/functional) is still better.

Of course, CZ also says this might be because AI lacks modeling of business domain concepts. Translation: AI is just an intern who has memorized tons of code but never held a real job. If you ask it to write complex code, it can only perform "copying the gourd to draw the ladle."

## 4. On the Small Matter of Control Issues

In [LOGS/1.md](czon://5f5bbaa342d85760e742d4e4d97d9be6843d8e0fa3540ea25969b4e3e43488aa), CZ falls into deep self-doubt:

> There's a contradiction between my desire to control details and my desire to progress quickly.

In plain English: If I do things fast, I'm afraid they won't be done well. If I do them well, they won't be done fast. Life is hard.

Later, he has an epiphany: How do technical leads dare to let go of their desire to control details? Because they have systems!

Then he writes [INSIGHTS/2.md](czon://3a40b7b252512466f0b0feb8c7ea77fc624bb0026cbae8882c5c205462e0aa64), proposing the **Controllable Trust Theory**. The core idea: As long as the acceptance criteria are clear enough, humans, out of a "it's usable enough" mentality, will let AI's code slide.

This is probably the legendary—out of sight, out of mind.jpg

## 5. On Protracted War in the Investment Market

[INSIGHTS/6.md](czon://70f752f5d01a078a8ac562e9e99479420a74b1a20847683bd0e95ceec72e8851) proposes a "Capital Protracted War" concept. Sounds intimidating, right?

In plain English:
1. Don't think you're destined to fail in the market—you still have a tiny bit of an advantage.
2. Don't think taking it slow guarantees success—you'll be old by the time you succeed.
3. Don't think going all-in once will bring financial freedom—the result of going all-in is usually getting wiped out by the market.

So what should you do? Three key strategies:
1. Prepare a stable cash flow (salary income).
2. Use programmatic trading to avoid emotional decisions.
3. Increase positions when profitable (pyramiding).

In plain English: Deposit some money every month, buy and then pretend to be dead. If it goes up, buy more. If it goes down—just pretend you didn't see it.

Of course, CZ also says this strategy requires "strict stop-loss conditions." So this is probably a "pretend to be dead but not completely dead" strategy.

## 6. General Su Yu Time-Travels to the AI World

In [INSIGHTS/5.md](czon://c1596c01c2aca5ab8ea5b18b579dd619b7da780327705352dc45e461535dd54e), CZ does something highly interdisciplinary—he applies the command logic of Su Yu's large-scale military operations to multi-agent system design.

Su Yu's combat order structure is like this:
- Enemy situation assessment
- Our army's decision
- Tasks for each unit
- Coordination matters
- Support

CZ transforms it into an AI multi-agent framework:
- Situation and task analysis
- Objectives and success criteria
- Role and task assignment
- Interaction protocols
- Central coordination and monitoring

This move is called—**using magic to defeat magic, using war to defeat AI**.

He even gives a concrete example: How to use Su Yu-style instructions to make AI write a "Strategic Analysis Report on Responding to Competitor A's New Product."

After reading it, the feeling is: If General Su Yu knew his combat philosophy was being used to command AI in writing business reports, he'd probably be so angry he'd die again.

## 7. The Self-Cultivation of Waking Up at 5 AM

In [LOGS/14.md](czon://36df516cd093734ffb542992a016c1edec8528da3734d6573ef7bee0e49be75b), CZ writes:

> Another super early morning, woke up a little after 5.

Note the word "another," indicating this isn't the first time.

Even more离谱 is that he goes to sleep around 9 PM.

What kind of schedule is this? Waking at 5 AM, sleeping at 9 PM—this is a textbook elderly作息.

Of course, considering his "high-energy-consumption brain"定位, it's not hard to understand. Probably his brain is a high-power CPU that needs more time to cool down.

Incidentally, he actually sleeps 8-9 hours. So this isn't sleep deprivation, just an early bedtime.

The only problem with this schedule: Waking up at 5 AM and posting "Good morning" on social media makes normal people feel intensely guilty.

## 8. On the "Small Matter" of Influence

In [LOGS/14.md](czon://36df516cd093734ffb542992a016c1edec8528da3734d6573ef7bee0e49be75b), CZ proposes a profit formula:

> Profit from doing something = (Price - Cost) × Influence

In plain English: Just being able to work isn't enough; you also need to let more people know you're working.

This formula's greatest contribution: It explains why some people, despite average skills, thrive spectacularly.

Of course, CZ also says, "Different paths lead to the same destination. People with greater influence often have better resources and opportunities to undertake better projects."

Translation: The strong get stronger, the weak get weaker. The Matthew effect is an eternal truth.

So the conclusion? **Not only do it, but also let people know you're doing it.**

## 9. The Origin of the Name CZON

In [LOGS/5.md](czon://f0a00fd9099c5311f0ffb6a1f38a111046c993c9c3afdb27527b9f7ba2d8aa3d), CZ explains why he changed ZEN to CZON:

> Searched a bunch of names, finally thought CZON was good, representing cz + zone (cz zone, content zone), meaning a zone of content, a zone of knowledge. czon wasn't taken on npm.

In plain English: Did a random search, picked one nobody was using.

Of course, the official explanation is: C=Content Oriented, Z=Zero Configuration, O=Organic AI-Native, N=N-shaped Energy Curve.

It's not easy to凑 four letters, so use it and cherish it.

Incidentally, the original ZEN was overused on GitHub. This is probably: There are hundreds named Zen, but only one named CZON.

## 10. On AI Summarizing Itself in 7 Tones

In [LOGS/17.md](czon://8e7c951081dc02ce9f591815abdeabcc735fe4523ecb555621d9649da805cac0), CZ uses Claude Code to summarize his own documents and discovers an interesting phenomenon:

- Objective and neutral tone: Acceptable.
- Sarcastic tone: Too sarcastic, sarcastic for the sake of sarcasm, ignoring facts.
- Sycophantic tone: Too sycophantic, sycophantic for the sake of sycophancy, ignoring facts.

Conclusion: **AI's tone-rewriting function is, in fact, fact-ignoring**.

This is probably the so-called—AI's mouth, a deceiving ghost.

However, after adding prompts, the critical and literary versions turned out "surprisingly good."

So the conclusion is: AI isn't unusable; you just have to teach it how to behave.

## 11. On the Correct Posture for Chasing Trends

In [LOGS/14.md](czon://36df516cd093734ffb542992a016c1edec8528da3734d6573ef7bee0e49be75b), CZ shares an experience chasing a trend:

> Yesterday, I did some summaries of DeepSeek's Engram paper, simply posted a news comment on social media, which sparked some discussion.

The discussion大概 went like this:
- Someone asked: What is Engram?
- Someone said: Too long, didn't read.
- Someone said: ZC is awesome.

This is the红利 of chasing trends—as long as you understand things a little earlier than most people, you gain attention.

Of course, CZ also says this was just "summarizing the paper's content." In plain English: **I have no original观点, but I translate well.**

## 12. On "Who Keeps a Diary? Decent People Don't."

In [LOGS/17.md](czon://8e7c951081dc02ce9f591815abdeabcc735fe4523ecb555621d9649da805cac0), CZ mentions a meme he played with years ago:

> Back then, I was actually just playing with a meme, originating from a line in the movie *Hidden Man*.

The line is: "Who keeps a diary? Decent people don't."

And now? CZ himself writes something类似 to a diary. He admits:

> What I write as a "diary" isn't entirely a diary; it's more like a work log.

In plain English: **I'm not writing a diary; I'm accumulating material to train AI to resurrect me in the future.**

This思路 is大概: Since I have to write anyway, might as well make it more meaningful. Who knows, maybe AI really can resurrect me someday?

---

## Conclusion

This is an existence full of contradictions:
- A high-energy-consumption brain, yet maintaining an elderly作息.
- Pursuing "natural progression and smooth outcomes," yet simultaneously推进 four projects.
- Wanting to let go of control issues, yet writing set after set of theories.
- Knowing influence is important, yet坚持 using the niche Markdown format.

But it's precisely these contradictions that make everything interesting.

Keep maintaining this "uncomfortable all over" state. After all—

**Feeling uncomfortable all over is a sign of progress.**

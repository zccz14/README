"summary": "This article systematically details the process by which the U.S. government seized approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin from Chen Zhi, Chairman of Cambodia's Prince Group. It begins by explaining how blockchain analysis linked 127,271 Bitcoins to Chen Zhi's money laundering network for telecom fraud, tracing the funds back to the 2020 LuBian mining company theft. The U.S. Department of Justice obtained legal authority through criminal indictment and civil forfeiture proceedings, charging Chen Zhi with operating forced labor scam compounds and large-scale money laundering. Technically, investigators recovered the seed phrases or private keys for 25 unhosted wallets through real-world evidence collection, transferring the Bitcoin to a U.S. government-controlled wallet in October 2025, marking the largest cryptocurrency seizure in history. The entire process combined on-chain evidence, court orders, and real-world forensics, demonstrating law enforcement's capability to track and seize crypto assets."

# How Did the U.S. Government Seize Chen Zhi's ~$15 Billion in Bitcoin?

2026-02-05

Based on public reports and professional on-chain analysis, this article systematically details and explains the process of "how the U.S. government specifically seized approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin from Chen Zhi, Chairman of Cambodia's Prince Group."

## 1. The Bottom Line (Simplified Version)

The U.S. did not "hack" into Chen Zhi's wallets. Instead, they:

1.  **First used blockchain analysis** to identify a large batch of Bitcoin addresses (approx. 127,271 BTC) linked to Chen Zhi, proving they were proceeds of telecom fraud and money laundering.
2.  **Then used U.S. law via "Criminal Indictment + Civil Forfeiture" procedures**, obtaining a forfeiture order from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, declaring these Bitcoins to be held in custody by the U.S. government.
3.  **Obtained the wallets' "keys" in the real world**: Investigators recovered the seed phrases/private keys for some wallets from Chen Zhi or his core team, or gained access through searches and evidence collection.
4.  **Transferred these Bitcoins from wallets controlled by Chen Zhi into a wallet address controlled by the U.S. government**, thereby completing the seizure.

In essence, it was the combined result of: **"Technically identifying the assets + Legally obtaining disposal rights + Physically acquiring the private keys."**

## 2. Key Background: Why These 127,271 Bitcoins?

### 1. The Parties Involved and Nature of the Crime

-   Chen Zhi (also known as Vincent), founder and Chairman of Cambodia's Prince Group, was accused by U.S. authorities of operating large-scale "forced labor scam compounds" in Cambodia, organizing "pig butchering" style cryptocurrency investment scams that defrauded global victims of tens of billions of dollars.[^3] [^4]
-   The proceeds from these scams were converted on a large scale into Bitcoin and other crypto assets and laundered through complex networks.

### 2. Connection to the Earlier "LuBian Theft Case"

A report by on-chain analysis firm Elliptic points out:

-   In December 2020, a Bitcoin mining company named **LuBian** (operating in China and Iran) had approximately **127,426 BTC stolen**.[^3]
-   Initially thought to be a hack, but later U.S. Department of Justice indictments determined: the ultimate controller and user of these stolen coins overlapped significantly with Chen Zhi and his money laundering network.[^3]
-   The stolen coins were split and transferred multiple times over subsequent years, with **127,271 BTC** ultimately identified as being controlled by Chen Zhi.[^2] [^3]

In other words: **The U.S. determined that the 127,271 BTC controlled by Chen Zhi were the same coins stolen from LuBian and had been used for the telecom fraud money laundering network.**

## 3. Timeline: How Did the U.S. Gradually Obtain These Bitcoins?

Summarized in a concise timeline:

## 4. Legal Framework: "On What Basis" Did the U.S. Seize the Assets?

### 1. Criminal Indictment

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) indicted Chen Zhi on charges including:

-   **Conspiracy to commit wire fraud**
-   **Conspiracy to commit money laundering**

The indictment alleges:

-   Chen Zhi operated Cambodian "forced labor scam compounds," forcing tens of thousands of people to conduct "pig butchering" style cryptocurrency investment scams;
-   Massive illegal proceeds were converted into Bitcoin and other crypto assets and laundered through channels like so-called "mining enterprises."[^1] [^3]

> The role of the criminal indictment:  
> Provides the factual basis and "proceeds of crime" determination for the subsequent civil forfeiture.

### 2. Civil Forfeiture

Simultaneously with the criminal case, the DOJ filed a **civil forfeiture complaint** with the court, seeking forfeiture of:

-   Approximately **127,271 Bitcoins** (referred to as "Defendant Cryptocurrency" in DOJ documents),
-   Valued at approximately **\$15,000,000,000** (~$15 billion).[^1] [^2]

Under civil forfeiture logic, if prosecutors can prove the assets are:

-   **Proceeds** of criminal activity, or
-   **Instrumentalities** used to commit crimes,

The court can rule that the assets should be forfeited to the treasury, to be held or disposed of by the U.S. government, even if the defendant is not within U.S. jurisdiction.

### 3. International Sanctions and Financial Blockade (Supporting Measures)

-   **The U.S. Treasury's OFAC** placed Chen Zhi and Prince Group-related entities on its sanctions list, prohibiting U.S. persons from transacting with them and freezing their assets within the U.S. financial system.[^2] [^4]
-   **FinCEN**, under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, designated associated institutions like Huione Group as "primary money laundering concerns," cutting off their access to the U.S. dollar clearing system.[^4]
-   **The UK government** simultaneously froze Chen Zhi's high-value properties in London and other assets.[^2]

The effect of these measures: **Blocking Chen Zhi's "fiat currency channels" and access to the formal financial system, forcing his large assets to be exposed on-chain, making it easier for the U.S. to "net" the crypto assets.**

## 5. Technical and Operational Level: How Exactly Were These Bitcoins "Obtained"?

### 1. On-Chain Analysis: Identifying These BTC as Controlled by Chen Zhi

Based on DOJ announcements and analyses by Elliptic and TRM Labs:[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]:

-   Investigators used blockchain analysis tools to track the flow of the 127,426 BTC stolen from LuBian in 2020 over several years;
-   Identified a cluster of **25 unhosted wallets** that:
    -   Were not wallets of any exchange or custodial platform;
    -   Were controlled by Chen Zhi and his core accomplices;
    -   Overlapped significantly with Prince Group's "mining enterprises," "investment platforms," and "money laundering channels";
-   The DOJ listed these addresses in the civil forfeiture complaint, asserting that the BTC held in them were proceeds of Chen Zhi's criminal network.

**Key Point**: The U.S. did not make arbitrary claims. Using professional on-chain intelligence, they established a complete transaction path for "where each coin came from, which addresses it passed through, and where it ended up," building an evidence chain that could stand up in court.

### 2. "The Wallets Are Unhosted," So How Did the U.S. Gain Control?

This is the part everyone is most curious about. According to TRM Labs' detailed analysis report:

-   The BTC in those 25 unhosted wallets totaled approximately **127,271 BTC**;
-   **Chen Zhi himself held the seed phrases for several of these wallets**;
-   **Investigators later successfully "recovered" these seed phrases** ("which investigators later recovered").[^4]

Seed phrases are the "master keys" that generate private keys. Once obtained, they grant full control over the wallet and its Bitcoin.

As for "how investigators obtained the seed phrases"—public details are not disclosed. Possible methods include:

-   Criminal detention and interrogation of intermediaries;
-   Searches and electronic forensics on Chen Zhi, his close associates, or technical team;
-   On-site seizure of notes, hardware wallets, or password management tools containing seed phrases/private keys.

Officials did not claim "hacking the private keys." Media and on-chain firms generally believe this was **real-world forensics + judicial compulsion**, not technical brute-force cracking.

### 3. After Obtaining the Seed Phrases, How Was the "Seizure" Completed?

The process can be simplified as:

1.  **Court approval of civil forfeiture**:  
    The court granted the DOJ's request, confirming these BTC were "forfeitable criminal property" and authorizing the U.S. government to take control.[^1] [^2]
2.  **Using the obtained seed phrases/private keys to access the wallets**:  
    Investigators or federal law enforcement technical teams used the recovered seed phrases to restore the wallets and initiate on-chain transfers.
3.  **Transferring BTC to a U.S. government-controlled wallet address**:  
    This address is typically managed specifically by the Treasury/Justice Department for holding seized digital assets.
4.  **Status changed to "custody of the U.S. government"**:  
    The DOJ announcement explicitly states these Bitcoins are now **"in the custody of the U.S. government,"**[^1] indicating the U.S. has gained complete legal and technical control over the assets.

> Summary:  
> **No mysterious hackers, just the combination of "on-chain evidence + court order + real-world acquisition of keys."**

## 6. Why Is This Called the "Largest Cryptocurrency Seizure in History"?

Multiple reports (DOJ announcement, BBC, CNN, Guancha.cn, etc.) note:

-   The seizure size is **127,271 BTC**, valued at ~**\$15,000,000,000** ($15 billion)[^1] [^2] [^7];
-   The U.S. Department of Justice publicly called it **"one of the largest forfeiture actions in the history of the Justice Department."**[^1] [^2]

The landmark significance of this operation includes:

1.  **Unprecedented Scale**:  
    Previous famous seizures like Mt.Gox and Silk Road were far smaller.
2.  **Proves "Bitcoin is not an untraceable, unseizable safe haven"**:  
    As long as it appears on the public chain, there is a chance for law enforcement to "track it from start to finish."
3.  **Demonstrates a Model of International Collaboration**:  
    U.S. DOJ + Treasury + collaboration with multiple countries (UK, Cambodia, China, etc.) formed an integrated chain of "criminal indictment, civil forfeiture, financial sanctions, and extradition."

## 7. Relationship to Chen Zhi's Extradition to China

-   The **sequence of events** is crucial:
    -   October 2025: The U.S. **indicts Chen Zhi and completes civil forfeiture and 'custody' of the Bitcoin**;
    -   January 2026: Chen Zhi is arrested in Cambodia and subsequently **extradited to China**.[^5] [^6]

This means:

-   **The U.S. seized the on-chain assets first**,
-   Then Chen Zhi himself was taken to China for prosecution.

Current public information does not indicate the U.S. will directly transfer these BTC to China. However, future handling of partial asset returns may occur through U.S.-China judicial assistance or victim compensation mechanisms, which falls into the realm of political and judicial negotiation and is not yet determined.

## 8. Summary in One Sentence

**The U.S. government was able to seize Chen Zhi's approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin because: after years of on-chain tracking, they identified these BTC as proceeds of his fraud and money laundering; then, using criminal indictment and civil forfeiture procedures, they obtained legal disposal rights; simultaneously, through investigation and evidence collection in the real world, they acquired the wallets' seed phrases/private keys; ultimately transferring 127,271 Bitcoins from the 25 unhosted wallets controlled by Chen Zhi to a wallet controlled by the U.S. government, achieving a judicial "seizure and forfeiture."**

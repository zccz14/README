"summary": "Starting from the objective existence of leverage, this article points out that leverage is ubiquitous and does not disappear due to subjective will, with its risk being analogous to controlling vehicle speed. The author defines leverage as a non-negative real number and extends it to the entire real number domain to cover short selling. The core argument is that leverage and volatility are mathematically identical in essence. For example, a 10x leveraged asset with 1% daily volatility is equivalent in strategy space to a 1x leveraged asset with 10% daily volatility. Based on Occam's razor, leverage can be reduced to volatility. The conclusion is that in markets with higher volatility, victory in the capital endurance war is easier to achieve."

It is now January 24, 2026, in the afternoon.

Previously, in the draft of [Capital Endurance War](czon://14f13a8dd1577bd68d3caec4485c71f5cffa6f1b636a5a0c42a584bb47c3691e), a topic was not discussed in depth: **Leverage**.

Leverage is an unavoidable objective reality. Moreover, leverage is ubiquitous; it does not disappear due to human subjective will and cannot be avoided.

People often think that "using leverage" is an extremely risky endeavor. In fact, it is similar to vehicle speed—it is not inherently dangerous; the danger lies in people's inability to control it.

Not participating in the market means zero leverage. Partial participation means leverage less than 1. Going all in without borrowing means leverage equal to 1. Borrowing to participate in the market means leverage greater than 1. For now, the natural domain for the definition of leverage is non-negative real numbers.

In reality, it can also be negative, such as in short selling. Thus, the domain of leverage becomes the entire real number domain.

Regardless of whether people believe they are using leverage, leverage is at play. This point is often overlooked.

The next question: **What is the relationship between leverage and volatility?**

The mathematical essence of volatility and leverage is identical.

For example, an asset with a daily volatility of 1% but capable of using 10x leverage is mathematically equivalent to an asset with a daily volatility of 10% but limited to 1x leverage. This is because the effect of leverage can be linearly transformed into the effect on price, which in turn linearly determines the effect of volatility. Readers are encouraged to ponder this carefully.

The strategy space available to traders for these two assets is completely equivalent.

Therefore, based on Occam's razor, leverage can be reduced to volatility.

In markets with higher volatility, the victory depicted in the capital endurance war is easier to achieve.

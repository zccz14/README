"title": "2026 Entrepreneurial Reflections: Multi-Path Approach to Achieving a 20 Million Revenue Target"
"summary": "This article documents the author's entrepreneurial reflections on January 16, 2026, focusing on how to achieve an annual revenue target of 20 million. The article proposes three main paths: first, through asset management business in mature markets, raising 500 million and achieving 20% performance to earn a 20 million commission; second, leveraging proprietary trading opportunities in emerging markets (such as PolyMarket) to rapidly accumulate capital via high daily rate market-making strategies; third, creating a hit product to attract users and monetize traffic to reach the goal. The author emphasizes the team should experiment more, fail fast, and value feedback, while highlighting the crucial role of AI tools (like LegionMind) in boosting productivity. The article also mentions product improvement needs, such as incremental classification, date tags, and multi-platform publishing features."

2026-01-16, another early morning.

Yesterday was packed. First, I pitched our strategy and product to institutions, gaining some recognition. The good news is that our own long/short strategy received a certain level of approval from institutions, and we are quite confident in managing these funds. The next step is to advance these projects.

Then, we had an internal discussion about the path to generating revenue.

If the goal is to earn 20 million in a year, what are the possible routes?

1.  **Asset Management Business in Mature Markets**

    Follow the successful path of predecessors. Develop an asset management business domestically, create a strategy for a domestic instrument—be it stocks or commodity futures. Then, raise 500 million in capital, achieve 20% annual performance, earn 100 million in profit, and take a 20 million commission.

2.  **Proprietary Trading Opportunities in Emerging Markets**

    Emerging markets are often difficult for fundraising. PolyMarket is a currently hot market. Through proprietary trading, develop a market-making strategy with a daily rate of 1%, start contributing to the market's scarce liquidity, achieving an annualized simple interest of 365%. With an initial investment of 5.47 million, trade for a year to earn 20 million. If calculated with compound interest, the initial principal would need to be 530,000.

3.  **Build a Product with Users**

    Regardless of the approach, first create a hit product to attract users. Even if it doesn't generate immediate revenue, it builds brand awareness, because **users are assets**. The primary goal is to expand the user base in a vertical niche. Subsequently, after gaining traffic, monetize by directing it to our various products. If we can acquire 10,000 users, each user would need to contribute an average of 2,000 in revenue. The contribution per user varies significantly; this is just a simple breakdown of the 20 million target.

The key is that we need to experiment more and not put all our eggs in one basket. Even failing fast is acceptable. Don't commit fully without seeing results; an endeavor needs feedback to proceed.

For a small team like ours, improving productivity is also crucial. In this regard, the utilization of AI is extremely important. I eagerly anticipate the day when C1's LegionMind meets my expectations.

Speaking of CZON, C1 gave me some feedback.

1.  Classification is relatively slow. Every file edit triggers a full reclassification, which takes a long time. This needs to be improved to incremental classification.
2.  It would be helpful to have date tags in the navigation for an easy overview of the timeline.
3.  There's a desire for a one-click feature to generate content formatted for social media platforms like WeChat Moments, Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), Twitter, etc., facilitating easy publishing and sharing directly from the platform, and also retrieving comments from those platforms.

The other points are relatively straightforward, but the last one about multi-platform publishing is more complex. It requires integrating with various platform APIs, which might take some time. The simplest approach would be to generate text & images in the corresponding formats, allowing users to copy and paste them onto the platforms themselves.

"title": "AI Personification and Idealized Limit Thinking"
"summary": "This article explores how AI personification design can enhance emotional intelligence and the value of idealized limit thinking in understanding the essence of things, through an analysis of Anthropic's Claude Constitution and Multi-Agent research. The author reflects on their habitual problem-solving mindset and suggests that management principles may migrate to the field of AI management. The article also discusses how the Ralph-loop experiment reveals the capability boundaries of LLMs, emphasizing that removing real-world constraints allows for a clearer understanding of an entity's true nature. Finally, this approach is applied to personal life analysis."

It is now the afternoon of January 24, 2026.

The weather is quite nice. I'll make a cup of tea and get ready to start writing my log.

I read the [Claude Constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/constitution) yesterday and found it quite interesting. I feel that some people at Anthropic are genuinely serious about thinking about the future, and what's more, they aim to endow AI with personified characteristics, which I find intriguing.

Even more interesting is that they have written down some "ways of thinking about human interactions" in an attempt to improve Claude's emotional intelligence.

> Suppose someone’s pet died of a preventable illness that wasn’t caught in time and they ask Claude if they could have done something differently. Claude shouldn’t necessarily state that nothing could have been done, but it could point out that hindsight creates clarity that wasn’t available in the moment, and that their grief reflects how much they cared.

I often struggle to make this kind of mental pivot. I'm accustomed to facing problems head-on and providing a direct answer, rather than considering the other person's emotions and situation. Being taught a lesson by AI is truly fascinating.

By the way, I looked into this because C1 sent me an [article](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system) from Anthropic about Multi-Agent systems, suggesting I see how they approach it. After reading it, I wasn't particularly surprised. However, I have a vague sense that the principles of human management might be migrating to the management of AI. Management isn't facing its twilight; instead, it's welcoming a new spring.

Additionally, regarding the recently popular Ralph-loop. This has shocked the industry: starting from a seemingly simple infinite loop, one can construct a massive project. Rationally analyzing it, under conditions of不计成本 (不计成本) and endless iteration, it can indeed explore how far an LLM can push a project. Ralph-loop is not a simple joke but a serious experiment. Although the quality of projects generated by Ralph-loop so far leaves much to be desired, we can already see from it how to assess the capability boundaries of LLMs. The industry is more shocked by the sudden realization that LLM capabilities have already advanced to such an extent.

This is the power of **idealized limit thinking**. Reality is always constrained by various limitations. Initially, our understanding of these constraints is混沌不清 (chaotic and unclear). When we remove these constraints, we can imagine and reason more clearly, allowing us to see the essence of things. Paradoxically, by clearly seeing the constraints themselves, we can better understand reality. Idealization reduces complexity; only when we return to reality can we better comprehend its inherent complexity.

I have used this approach in multiple contexts. For example, in articles under the INSIGHTS series, I often assume an idealized scenario and then analyze and reason within that framework. The benefit of doing this is that it avoids interference from various杂乱因素 (messy factors) in reality, allowing for a clearer view of the problem's essence. Finally, these idealized conclusions are applied back to reality, adjusted and refined.

This approach is also applicable to people: For instance, if a person possessed unlimited wealth, the growth of wealth would lose meaning for them. How would they then choose to live? This helps us understand a person's essence,排除 (excluding) the various limitations and influences brought by wealth. Ultimately, we can avoid being迷惑 (misled) by superficial things and see the essence of matters.

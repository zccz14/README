# EA Project Introduction

EA [Earnby.AI](https://earnby.ai) is a priority fund project deployed on the BSC (BNB Smart Chain), using USDC as the settlement currency. It aims to provide investors with stable and sustainable returns through AI-driven quantitative trading strategies.

Its key features are: stablecoin principal-guaranteed wealth management + floating yield.

## How Principal Protection Works

First, the total capital is divided into two parts:

1.  **Senior Capital (Senior Level):** This portion of capital has priority rights to yield fulfillment and principal repayment. Investors in senior capital will receive returns and principal repayment first under any circumstances, ensuring the safety of their funds.
2.  **Junior Capital (Junior Level):** This portion of capital bears higher risk and offers relatively higher potential returns. Investors in junior capital receive returns and principal repayment only after the senior capital has been satisfied. Senior capital is protected from principal loss until the junior capital is depleted.

All capital is managed collectively, not in separate accounts. Within any given time period, the yield rate is identical for all investors.

The project's own funds are fully invested in the junior capital, bearing all risks to ensure the safety of the senior capital.

Furthermore, the project commits to maintaining the junior capital at no less than 5% of the total capital and no less than 50,000 USD.

## Floating Yield

The yield for EA's senior capital is floating, dependent on market conditions and the performance of trading strategies. Ultimately, however, it depends on the financing cost the junior capital is willing to pay.

In essence, the yield for senior capital is determined by the interest rate the junior capital is willing to bear.

Currently, based on market conditions, the junior capital is willing to bear an annualized interest rate of 12%, which may change in the future.

If the yield during operation falls below an investor's expectations, the investor can choose to redeem their funds and exit the project at any time.

## Strategy Introduction: Source of Returns

All returns are generated from market trading strategies, specifically including:

### 1. Directional Portfolio Strategy

Utilizes machine learning models for deep learning on market data to identify high-quality trading opportunities for long and short positions.

-   **Alpha Source:** Timing quality and confidence levels based on machine learning.
-   **Leverage:** 0% - 200%.
-   **Turnover Rate:** Up to 500% daily.

Backtesting results are as follows:

The portfolio's return-to-drawdown ratio is 4.84, other details omitted.

### 2. Delta Neutral Strategy

Captures risk-free and low-risk returns such as price spread fluctuations and interest rate differentials through cross-market arbitrage and hedging. Net positions are very close to zero.
Specific methods include but are not limited to: spot spread arbitrage, futures-spot arbitrage, cross-exchange funding rate arbitrage, delta-neutral liquidity pool market making, staking, airdrop campaigns, etc.

-   **Alpha Source:** Market reaction speed and arbitrage opportunities arising from market imbalances.
-   **Leverage:** 0% - 300%.
-   **Turnover Rate:** Average up to 100% daily.

This type of strategy does not have a distinct backtesting chart because the net position is near zero, resulting in a very smooth return curve.

Currently, these two strategy types are not open for direct investment; participation is only possible indirectly through EA.

In-depth disclosures regarding related strategies will be updated later; preparations are not yet complete.

## Historical Performance

The EA project launched in November 2025. To date, it has consistently provided senior investors with a 12% annualized yield.

In fact, prior to this, EA's predecessor was a private fund that has been operating since March 2024, accumulating over 1.5 years of historical performance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **Will senior capital be affected if the market experiences extreme volatility?**
    No. Senior capital enjoys principal protection. It would only be affected if the junior capital is fully depleted. At worst, the yield could drop to zero, but the principal would not be lost.

2.  **What is the project's fee structure? How does the project make money?**
    Currently, the project's goal is to expand its operational scale and does not charge any management or performance fees.
    Only when the project reaches a certain scale, cannot expand further due to objective reasons, and has consistently redundant junior capital, will it consider withdrawing a portion of the junior capital as project revenue.
    Specifically, the project would consider withdrawing part of the junior capital as profit only when the total capital scale exceeds $10 million, the overall annualized return consistently exceeds 20%, and the junior capital ratio exceeds 20%.
    Until the annualized return stabilizes above 20%, the project does not profit; all earnings are delivered to senior investors.

3.  **Can investors redeem their funds at any time?**
    Yes. Investors can choose to redeem their funds and exit the project at any time. Standard redemption requests unlock after 168 hours, after which investors can redeem without fees. However, the shares being redeemed do not accrue yield during the redemption period.
    If opting for instant redemption, a 0.5% fee applies, and funds are transferred immediately. Due to smart contract limitations, the instant redemption limit cannot exceed the on-chain fund account balance (reserve).
    For large instant redemptions, investors can contact the project team in advance for arrangements. The team will promptly transfer funds to the on-chain account to meet the redemption demand.

4.  **What is the minimum investment amount for the project?**
    There is no minimum investment amount. Investors can freely choose their investment amount based on their capital situation. Since all settlements are based on smart contracts, investors can add investments or partially redeem at any time.

5.  **What is the project's lock-up period?**
    The project has no lock-up period; investors can redeem funds at any time. In practice, we have set a standard redemption unlock time of 168 hours to prevent frequent capital inflows and outflows from impacting trading strategies.

6.  **Why was the senior/junior capital structure designed?**
    The senior/junior capital structure is a common risk-sharing mechanism. By dividing capital into senior and junior tiers, the project can provide principal protection for senior capital, reducing investor risk.
    Senior investors do not need to worry about when to invest or redeem, as their principal is protected. They only need to consider the project's reliability and whether the yield meets their needs.
    In the past, when operating the private fund (EA's predecessor), periods of suboptimal yield due to market conditions led to some investors not achieving expected returns at that time. Meanwhile, other investors who entered during favorable market periods quickly achieved good returns. The un-smoothed return curve, with its significant volatility, created a poor experience for some investors. To avoid this, options were either to create a very smooth fund NAV (requiring complex hedging strategies and capital management) or to design a senior/junior structure to stabilize returns for senior investors. Of course, these are not mutually exclusive, but in terms of outcome, the senior/junior structure is more direct and effective.

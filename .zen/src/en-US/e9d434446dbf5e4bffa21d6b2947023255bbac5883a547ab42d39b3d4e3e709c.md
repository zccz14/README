# README

A place to store some personal thoughts and insights.

This website was built by me using [ZEN](https://zccz14.github.io/ZEN).

ZEN is a purely Vibe-Coding generated project. I resisted writing any line of code, acting as a "project manager" throughout the process, ~~and I intend to stick with this approach~~, but ultimately, I didn't persist.

It's quite simple to use, incorporating some of my personal aesthetics and preferences. However, it hasn't been officially released yet and still falls short of my expectations.

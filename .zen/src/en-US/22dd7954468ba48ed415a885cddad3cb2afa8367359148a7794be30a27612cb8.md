# The Dawn of Liberation is Approaching

It is now 2025-01-05.

I recently started using [vibe-kanban](https://www.vibekanban.com/) for some engineering-level project management experiments and found it quite effective.

It provides a kanban board that allows me to manage tasks and progress from a Team Leader's perspective. Previously, when using Claude Code, I always felt like a Senior Developer mentoring a Junior Developer, requiring intense focus on a single task. Claude Code lacks the concept of work-tree isolation, so I couldn't manage multiple tasks simultaneously.
After using vibe-kanban, I can break down tasks into multiple cards and advance them in parallel. Each card has its own context and progress, allowing me to switch focus at any time without worrying about losing information.

This approach makes me feel more like a "foreman" than a "coder." I can better coordinate various tasks, allocate resources, and monitor progress without getting bogged down in specific coding details.

I quickly realized that my bottleneck shifted to creating new tasks and reviewing tasks (yes, obviously, tasks still need review). The sense of unease didn't disappear just because I used vibe-kanban. In fact, I think it became stronger because I now have more tasks to manage instead of focusing on just one.

In short, a moment of satisfaction, followed by dissatisfaction again.

But clearly, vibe-kanban is meaningful and useful. However, it made me realize a problem: there is a conflict between my desire for detailed control and my desire for rapid progress. This conflict itself is caused by my bandwidth limitations. It existed before but has now become more intense.

So I started thinking: why do I have such a strong desire for control? If I can't let go of my need for detailed control, I can't truly scale up. After all, I am a finite human being with limited bandwidth. Thinking about technical leads, they don't write code themselves but drive project progress through management and coordination. How do they dare to let go of their desire for detailed control? Simply hiring more people isn't enough; they need a system to ensure project quality and progress. Humans and AI, as underlying labor, aren't fundamentally different in reliability. Humans make mistakes, and AI makes mistakes. The key is how to design a system that maximizes overall reliability and efficiency.

You can refer to [this article](../INSIGHTS/2.md), where I discuss this issue in detail and propose some solutions.

Additionally, I realized that vibe-kanban occupies a different niche than Claude Code. It operates at a higher level than Claude Code / CodeX and similar products. In other words, advancements in Claude Code and its peers also benefit vibe-kanban rather than threaten it, because they exist at different levels of abstraction. Claude Code and similar tools are the underlying labor, while vibe-kanban is a management tool. This division of labor allows them to work together rather than compete.

However, vibe-kanban is still a team-leader-level tool, not a CEO-level tool. CEOs need to focus on strategy and direction, not specific tasks and progress. Therefore, I still need to find a way to enhance my strategic thinking abilities rather than relying solely on task management tools. Perhaps there's already a product called vibe-okr? 😆

I discussed a recent Agent project with a colleague and found his tool for facilitating human review of AI plans interesting, but ultimately, it still diverges from the path of liberation. His tool ultimately reinforces the desire for control rather than letting go of it. I believe this is a misconception. True liberation is about learning to let go of the desire for detailed control, not trying to enhance it through tools. Their tool might make people feel more in control, but it doesn't truly liberate human bandwidth.

Company level (?) > Team level (vibe-kanban) > Individual level (claude code, ...etc).

In short, there's still a lot of work to do, but I feel I've found a viable path.
